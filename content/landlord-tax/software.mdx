faqs:
  - question: "What is the best tax software for UK landlords?"
    answer: "The best software depends on your needs. TaxFolio offers tax-focused simplicity with bank feeds and MTD compliance from £69.99/year. FreeAgent and QuickBooks offer fuller accounting features at higher prices. Hammock is landlord-specific but more expensive."
  - question: "Do landlords need accounting software?"
    answer: "Not required currently, but from April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), landlords must use MTD-compatible software for digital record keeping and quarterly submissions. Using software now makes the transition easier."
  - question: "Can landlords use free tax software?"
    answer: "HMRC's online service is free for filing Self Assessment, but doesn't offer bank feeds, expense tracking, or MTD quarterly submissions. For proper record keeping and MTD compliance, paid software is more practical."
  - question: "What features should landlord software have?"
    answer: "Essential features: property income tracking, expense categorisation, Section 24 mortgage interest handling, SA105 filing, and MTD compliance. Useful extras: bank feeds, multiple property management, receipt capture, and tax calculations."
