faqs:
  - question: "What expenses can landlords claim against rental income?"
    answer: "Landlords can claim letting agent fees, repairs and maintenance, insurance, ground rent, service charges, accountant fees, legal costs, travel to properties, and advertising. Mortgage interest is now a 20% tax credit, not a deductible expense."
  - question: "Can landlords claim mortgage interest as an expense?"
    answer: "No. Since Section 24, mortgage interest cannot be deducted from rental income. Instead, you receive a 20% tax credit on your interest payments. This affects higher-rate taxpayers most significantly."
  - question: "What's the difference between repairs and improvements?"
    answer: "Repairs restore something to its original condition and are fully deductible. Improvements enhance or upgrade beyond original specification and are capital expenditure—only relieved when you sell the property."
  - question: "Can landlords claim for a new kitchen or bathroom?"
    answer: "Only if it's a like-for-like replacement. Replacing a basic kitchen with a basic kitchen is a repair. Upgrading to a premium kitchen is an improvement (capital) and not deductible from rental income."

Landlords can claim allowable expenses against rental income to reduce their tax bill. Deductible expenses include letting agent fees, repairs, insurance, ground rent, professional fees, and travel to properties. Since Section 24, mortgage interest is no longer deductible—you receive a 20% tax credit instead.

This guide lists all allowable landlord expenses and explains what you can and cannot claim.

## How Landlord Expenses Work

Allowable expenses reduce your **taxable rental profit**:

**Rental Profit = Rental Income − Allowable Expenses**

You pay Income Tax on the profit at your marginal rate (20%, 40%, or 45%).

**Important:** Mortgage interest is handled separately under Section 24. It's not deducted from income—you receive a 20% tax credit instead.

## Fully Deductible Expenses

These expenses reduce your rental income pound-for-pound:

## Mortgage Interest (Section 24)

Since April 2020, mortgage interest is **not deductible** from rental income. Instead, you receive a **20% tax credit**.

### How Section 24 Works

1. Calculate rental profit **without** deducting mortgage interest
2. Pay Income Tax on this full amount
3. Receive a 20% tax credit on your mortgage interest

### Example

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Rental income | £15,000 |
| Allowable expenses | £3,000 |
| Taxable rental profit | £12,000 |
| Tax at 40% | £4,800 |
| Mortgage interest paid | £6,000 |
| Section 24 credit (20% × £6,000) | −£1,200 |
| **Final tax** | **£3,600** |

**Impact:** Higher-rate taxpayers receive only 20% relief on mortgage interest, not their 40% or 45% marginal rate.

## Repairs vs Improvements

This distinction is crucial—get it wrong and HMRC may disallow claims.

### Repairs (Deductible)

Repairs restore something to its **original condition** or replace **like-for-like**:

| Repair | Why It's Allowable |
|--------|-------------------|
| Replacing broken boiler with similar model | Like-for-like replacement |
| Fixing roof tiles | Restoring to working condition |
| Repainting walls | Maintenance of original finish |
| Replacing worn carpets with similar quality | Like-for-like |
| Fixing leaking pipes | Restoring function |

### Improvements (Capital—Not Deductible)

Improvements **enhance** the property beyond its original state:

| Improvement | Why It's Not Allowable |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Adding a new room | Adds to property |
| Converting loft to bedroom | Enhancement |
| Installing central heating (where none existed) | Enhancement |
| Upgrading basic kitchen to premium kitchen | Enhancement |
| Adding double glazing | Enhancement |
| Building an extension | Adds to property |

**Capital expenditure:** Not deductible from rental income, but may reduce Capital Gains Tax when you sell.

### The Grey Area: Replacements

When replacing an item, the key question is: **what was there before?**

| Scenario | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| Replace single-glazed with double-glazed | Capital (improvement) |
| Replace old double-glazing with new double-glazing | Revenue (repair) |
| Replace basic boiler with basic boiler | Revenue (repair) |
| Replace basic boiler with smart/premium system | Part revenue, part capital |
| Replace like-for-like kitchen | Revenue (repair) |
| Upgrade kitchen significantly | Capital (improvement) |

**HMRC guidance:** If an item is replaced with the nearest modern equivalent, it's typically a repair. Significant upgrades are capital.

## Replacement of Domestic Items Relief

For **furnished** properties, you can claim the cost of replacing furnishings:

| Claimable | Not Claimable |
|-----------|---------------|
| Replacing old sofa with new sofa | Initial furnishing cost |
| Replacing worn curtains | Upgrading curtains significantly |
| Replacing broken bed | Additional furniture |
| Replacing appliances (like-for-like) | Premium upgrades |

**Calculation:** Cost of new item, minus any proceeds from disposing of old item, minus any improvement element.

**Note:** This replaces the old Wear and Tear Allowance (10% of rent). You can only claim actual replacement costs now.

## Expenses During Void Periods

When a property is empty between tenants:

| Expense | Allowable? |
|---------|------------|
| Council tax | Yes |
| Utilities (keeping property heated) | Yes |
| Insurance | Yes |
| Repairs/maintenance | Yes |
| Marketing to find new tenants | Yes |
| Mortgage interest | Yes (for Section 24 credit) |

Void period expenses are deductible as long as you intend to re-let the property.

## Pre-Letting Expenses

Expenses incurred before your first tenant:

| Expense | Allowable? |
|---------|------------|
| Repairs to make habitable | Possibly (if restoring, not improving) |
| Professional fees for letting | Yes |
| Advertising | Yes |
| Accountant setup fees | Yes |
| Property purchase costs | No (capital) |
| Stamp duty | No (capital) |

**Pre-letting repairs:** If a property needs significant work before first letting, HMRC may argue this is capital (bringing to lettable standard, not maintaining). Minor repairs are usually allowed.

## Multiple Properties

If you own several rental properties, they're treated as **one property business**:

- Combine all income
- Combine all expenses
- Loss on one property offsets profit on another
- File a single property income section (SA105)

**Record keeping:** Track expenses by property for your own analysis, but HMRC sees combined totals.

## Expenses Record Keeping

### What to Keep

For each expense:
- Receipt or invoice
- Proof of payment
- Date
- What property it relates to (if tracking individually)
- Category (repairs, insurance, etc.)

### How Long to Keep

Keep records for **6 years** after the tax year. HMRC can enquire within this period.

### Organising Receipts

Options:
- Physical folder by property/year
- Digital scans in cloud storage
- Accounting software with receipt capture

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Claiming Improvements as Repairs

Upgrading a kitchen is capital expenditure. Be honest about whether work is maintenance or enhancement.

### 2. Forgetting Section 24

Don't deduct mortgage interest from income—it's a separate tax credit calculation.

### 3. Missing Allowable Expenses

Many landlords miss:
- Mileage to properties
- Landlord association memberships
- Software subscriptions
- Bank charges

### 4. No Receipts

Without evidence, HMRC can disallow claims. Keep everything.

### 5. Claiming Personal Use

If you occasionally use the property personally (holiday home), apportion expenses. Only claim the rental portion.

## Expense Categories for SA105

When completing the property pages of your Self Assessment:

| SA105 Category | What to Include |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Rent, rates, insurance, ground rents | Buildings insurance, ground rent, service charges |
| Property repairs and maintenance | All repairs, decorating, garden maintenance |
| Finance costs | For Section 24 tax credit calculation |
| Legal, management, and other professional fees | Agent fees, accountant, legal |
| Costs of services provided | Cleaning, utilities if landlord pays |
| Other allowable property expenses | Travel, advertising, safety certificates |

## Maximising Your Expense Claims

### 1. Review All Categories

Use this guide as a checklist. Are you claiming everything allowable?

### 2. Keep Detailed Records

The more organised your records, the less likely you'll miss expenses.

### 3. Separate Property Bank Account

Makes tracking income and expenses much simpler.

### 4. Use Software

Property accounting software tracks expenses and categorises correctly.

### 5. Plan Repairs Strategically

If you're a higher-rate taxpayer, repairs give 40% relief. Time larger repair jobs to maximise relief.
