    answer: "Yes. Airbnb income is taxable. However, you may qualify for reliefs: Rent a Room scheme (£7,500 tax-free if renting a room in your home) or Property Allowance (£1,000 tax-free for any rental income). Above these, you pay Income Tax on profits."
  - question: "Does Airbnb report my income to HMRC?"
    answer: "Yes. From 2024, Airbnb and other digital platforms must report host income to HMRC. Even if it wasn't reported before, you're legally required to declare all taxable income on your Self Assessment return."
  - question: "Can I use Rent a Room scheme for Airbnb?"
    answer: "Yes, if you're renting a room in your main home (where you also live). You can earn up to £7,500 tax-free under Rent a Room. This includes Airbnb, Booking.com, or any short-term rental. It doesn't apply if you rent the whole property."
  - question: "What expenses can Airbnb hosts claim?"
    answer: "If not using a tax-free allowance, you can claim: Airbnb service fees, cleaning costs, toiletries and supplies, utilities (proportioned), insurance, repairs, and a proportion of mortgage interest (as Section 24 tax credit for residential property)."

Airbnb hosts must pay tax on rental income. If you rent a room in your home, you may qualify for the **Rent a Room scheme** (£7,500 tax-free). If renting a whole property, the **Property Allowance** gives £1,000 tax-free. Above these thresholds, you pay Income Tax on your profit. Since 2024, Airbnb reports host income directly to HMRC.

This guide covers Airbnb tax obligations, reliefs, expenses, and how to report your income.

## Does HMRC Know About My Airbnb Income?

**Yes.** From January 2024, digital platforms including Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo must report seller/host information to HMRC under the OECD's Platform Reporting Rules.

Airbnb reports:
- Your name and address
- Tax identification number (if provided)
- Total income received through the platform
- Number of bookings

HMRC can compare this data to your Self Assessment return. Unreported income is likely to be discovered.

## Rent a Room Scheme (£7,500 Tax-Free)

The **Rent a Room scheme** lets you earn up to **£7,500 per year tax-free** from renting furnished accommodation in your main home.

### Who Qualifies

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Your main home | The property must be where you live |
| Furnished room | Guests have use of furnished accommodation |
| You live there too | You're in residence during lettings |
| UK property | The property is in the UK |

### What Counts

| Eligible | Not Eligible |
|----------|--------------|
| Renting a spare bedroom | Renting whole property (you move out) |
| Renting multiple rooms (you stay) | Separate annex/flat (not your home) |
| Short-term Airbnb guests | Second home/holiday let |
| Long-term lodgers | |

### How It Works

| Your Airbnb Income | Tax Treatment |
|-------------------|---------------|
| £7,500 or less | Tax-free (no need to report) |
| Over £7,500 | Choose: deduct £7,500 OR claim actual expenses |

**Example 1:** You earn £5,000 from Airbnb (spare room). Tax-free under Rent a Room.

**Example 2:** You earn £12,000 from Airbnb (spare room).
- **Option A:** £12,000 − £7,500 allowance = £4,500 taxable
- **Option B:** £12,000 − actual expenses (say £3,000) = £9,000 taxable
- **Choose Option A** (lower taxable amount)

### Shared Ownership

If you share the property with a partner who also receives Rent a Room income, the £7,500 limit is halved to £3,750 each.

### Opting Out

If your expenses exceed £7,500, opt out of the scheme and claim actual expenses instead. You must actively elect this by the Self Assessment deadline.

## Property Allowance (£1,000 Tax-Free)

If you **don't** qualify for Rent a Room (e.g., renting a whole property), the **Property Allowance** provides £1,000 tax-free.

### Who Can Use It

Any individual with property income can use the Property Allowance:

- Whole property short-term lets
- Second home rentals
- Holiday lets
- Room rentals (if not using Rent a Room)

### How It Works

| Your Rental Income | Tax Treatment |
|-------------------|---------------|
| £1,000 or less | Tax-free (no Self Assessment needed for this income) |
| Over £1,000 | Choose: deduct £1,000 OR claim actual expenses |

**Example:** You earn £3,500 from a holiday let.
- **Option A:** £3,500 − £1,000 allowance = £2,500 taxable
- **Option B:** £3,500 − actual expenses (say £2,800) = £700 taxable
- **Choose Option B** if expenses are higher

### Choosing Between Allowances

| Situation | Best Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| Renting room in main home, income under £7,500 | Rent a Room (£7,500) |
| Renting whole property, expenses under £1,000 | Property Allowance (£1,000) |
| Renting whole property, significant expenses | Claim actual expenses |

**You cannot use both** Rent a Room and Property Allowance on the same income.

## Claiming Actual Expenses

If your expenses exceed the allowance (or you want more precision), claim actual costs.

### Allowable Airbnb Expenses

| Expense | Claimable? |
|---------|------------|
| Airbnb service fees | Yes |
| Cleaning costs | Yes |
| Laundry and linens | Yes |
| Toiletries and supplies | Yes |
| Welcome gifts | Yes |
| Professional photography | Yes |
| Key safe/lock box | Yes |
| Guest communication tools | Yes |
| Insurance (host liability) | Yes |
| Repairs and maintenance | Yes |
| Utilities (proportioned) | Yes |
| Council tax (proportioned or void periods) | Yes |
| Mortgage interest | Yes (as Section 24 credit) |
| Furniture replacement | Yes |
| Safety equipment (smoke alarms, etc.) | Yes |

### Proportioning Expenses

If the property is also your home, apportion expenses:

**By time:** Days let ÷ 365 × annual cost

**By space:** Rooms let ÷ total rooms × cost

**Example:** Spare room let for 100 nights/year, total electricity £1,200.
- Proportion: 100 ÷ 365 = 27.4%
- Room: 1 ÷ 5 rooms = 20%
- Combined: 27.4% × 20% = 5.5%
- Claim: £1,200 × 5.5% = £66

### Mortgage Interest (Section 24)

If your Airbnb is residential property (not a Furnished Holiday Let), **Section 24** applies:

- Cannot deduct mortgage interest from income
- Receive 20% tax credit on interest payments

Learn more: [Section 24 Explained](/landlord-tax/section-24)

## Furnished Holiday Lettings (FHL) Rules

**Important Update:** FHL tax advantages are being abolished from **April 2025**.

### Before April 2025

Properties qualifying as FHL had benefits:
- Full mortgage interest deduction (no Section 24)
- Capital allowances on furniture
- Business Asset Disposal Relief on sale
- Profits counted as "earnings" for pension contributions

### From April 2025

FHL properties will be treated the same as regular residential lettings:
- Section 24 mortgage restrictions apply
- No special capital allowances
- Standard property income rules

If you have a qualifying FHL, 2024/25 is the last year of these benefits.

## Airbnb Tax Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Spare Room (Under Rent a Room Threshold)

**Emma: Rents spare bedroom on Airbnb**
- Income: £4,200/year
- Rent a Room threshold: £7,500

**Tax:** £0 (within Rent a Room allowance)
**Action:** No need to report on Self Assessment

### Example 2: Spare Room (Over Threshold)

**Tom: Popular spare room in London**
- Income: £10,000/year
- Expenses: £1,500

**Option A (Rent a Room):**
- Taxable: £10,000 − £7,500 = £2,500
- Tax at 20%: £500

**Option B (Actual Expenses):**
- Taxable: £10,000 − £1,500 = £8,500
- Tax at 20%: £1,700

**Best choice:** Rent a Room (saves £1,200)

### Example 3: Whole Property Short-Let

**Sarah: Rents entire flat on Airbnb while travelling**
- Income: £15,000/year
- Expenses: £4,500 (cleaning, fees, utilities, repairs)
- Mortgage interest: £3,000

**Option A (Property Allowance):**
- Taxable: £15,000 − £1,000 = £14,000
- Tax at 40%: £5,600

**Option B (Actual Expenses):**
- Profit: £15,000 − £4,500 = £10,500
- Tax at 40%: £4,200
- Section 24 credit: £3,000 × 20% = −£600
- Net tax: £3,600

**Best choice:** Actual expenses (saves £2,000)

### Example 4: Second Home Holiday Let

**James: Holiday cottage on Airbnb**
- Income: £25,000/year
- Expenses: £8,000
- Mortgage interest: £6,000

**Calculation:**
- Profit: £25,000 − £8,000 = £17,000
- Tax at 40%: £6,800
- Section 24 credit: £6,000 × 20% = −£1,200
- **Net tax: £5,600**

## When to Register for Self Assessment

You must register for Self Assessment if:

| Situation | Registration Required? |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Airbnb income over £1,000 (whole property) | Yes |
| Airbnb income over £7,500 (room in home) | Yes |
| Airbnb income under thresholds but want to claim expenses | Yes |
| Airbnb income under thresholds, using allowance | No |

Register by **5 October** following the tax year: [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment)

## Reporting Airbnb Income

### Where to Report

On your Self Assessment return (SA100), complete the **Property Income** section (SA105):

- Total rental income
- Allowable expenses (or state you're using Property Allowance)
- Mortgage interest (for Section 24 credit)
- Net profit

### Filing Deadline

**31 January** following the tax year.

For 2024/25 income (6 April 2024 – 5 April 2025): file by **31 January 2026**.

## Council Tax and Business Rates

Short-term letting may affect your council tax:

| Situation | Likely Treatment |
|-----------|------------------|
| Occasional Airbnb in main home | Council tax continues |
| Regular short-lets in second home | May become business rates |
| Advertised 140+ days/year | Often switches to business rates |

Check with your local council. Business rates may be higher or lower than council tax, and you may qualify for Small Business Rate Relief.

## Planning Permission and Regulations

### 90-Day Rule (London)

In Greater London, you generally cannot short-let your entire home for more than **90 nights per year** without planning permission.

Airbnb automatically stops bookings at 90 nights for London properties (unless you confirm permission).

### Other Areas

Outside London, check local rules. Some areas have Article 4 Directions restricting short-term lets.

### Building Regulations

Ensure your property meets safety standards:
- Working smoke alarms
- Carbon monoxide detectors (if gas appliances)
- Gas safety certificate (if applicable)
- Electrical safety check
- Fire safety measures
