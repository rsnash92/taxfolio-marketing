    answer: "Report rental income on the property pages (SA105) of your Self Assessment tax return. Enter total rent received, allowable expenses, and mortgage interest (for Section 24 credit). File online by 31 January following the tax year."
  - question: "Do I need to report rental income under £2,500?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. If rental income is under £2,500 and you're not claiming expenses, you may not need to file Self Assessment. But if you want to claim expenses, or have other reasons to file, include it on SA105."
  - question: "What is form SA105?"
    answer: "SA105 is the UK property income supplementary pages for Self Assessment. It's where landlords report rental income, property expenses, and mortgage interest. It's completed as part of your main SA100 tax return."
  - question: "How do I report mortgage interest on rental property?"
    answer: "Enter mortgage interest separately in the 'Finance costs' box on SA105. It's not deducted from income—instead, HMRC calculates a 20% tax credit. This is the Section 24 restriction."

Landlords report rental income on the **SA105** property pages of their Self Assessment tax return. You enter total rent received, claim allowable expenses, and separately report mortgage interest for the Section 24 tax credit. The return is due by **31 January** following the tax year.

This guide walks you through completing the property income section step by step.

## Do I Need to Report Rental Income?

### You Must Report If:

| Situation | Action Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Rental income over £2,500 | File Self Assessment with SA105 |
| Rental income over £1,000 and claiming expenses | File Self Assessment with SA105 |
| Already filing Self Assessment for other reasons | Include property income on SA105 |

### You May Not Need to Report If:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Rental income under £1,000 | Property Allowance covers it—no reporting |
| Rental income £1,000-£2,500 (not claiming expenses) | Can use Property Allowance—no SA105 |

**Property Allowance:** £1,000 tax-free allowance for small amounts of rental income. If you want to claim expenses instead, you must file SA105.

## Before You Start

Gather these documents:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Rental income records | Total rent received |
| Expense receipts | Costs to deduct |
| Mortgage statements | Interest for Section 24 |
| Agent statements | If using a letting agent |
| Property details | Addresses, ownership dates |

## Completing Form SA105

### Section 1: Property Income

**Box 20: Total rents and other income from property**

Enter the total rent received during the tax year (6 April – 5 April).

| Include | Don't Include |
|---------|---------------|
| Rent payments | Deposits held |
| Airbnb/short-let income | Returned deposits |
| Service charges passed to you | Capital receipts |
| Insurance claim payouts | Personal use of property |

**Example:** Three properties with rent of £12,000, £9,600, and £14,400 = **£36,000**

### Section 2: Property Expenses

Enter allowable expenses by category:

**Box 21: Rent, rates, insurance, ground rents**

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Ground rent | £xxx |
| Service charges | £xxx |
| Buildings insurance | £xxx |
| Council tax (void periods) | £xxx |

**Box 22: Property repairs and maintenance**

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Repairs to structure | £xxx |
| Decorating | £xxx |
| Garden maintenance | £xxx |
| Appliance repairs | £xxx |

**Box 23: Finance costs**

This is for **mortgage interest** and other finance costs. Enter the total—this feeds into the Section 24 tax credit calculation.

**Box 24: Legal, management and other professional fees**

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Letting agent fees | £xxx |
| Accountant fees | £xxx |
| Legal fees (tenancy) | £xxx |

**Box 25: Costs of services provided**

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Cleaning | £xxx |
| Gardening services | £xxx |
| Utilities (if landlord pays) | £xxx |

**Box 26: Other allowable property expenses**

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Travel to properties | £xxx |
| Stationery, phone | £xxx |
| Safety certificates | £xxx |
| Advertising | £xxx |

### Section 3: Calculating Profit

**Box 27: Private use adjustment**

If you used the property personally (e.g., holiday home), reduce expenses by the private use proportion.

**Box 28: Balancing charge**

For capital allowances on furnished holiday lets (if applicable).

**Box 29: Capital allowances**

Claim for qualifying equipment in furnished holiday lets.

**Box 30: Landlord's energy saving allowance**

Rarely used—for certain energy improvements to let property.

**Box 31: Total expenses**

Sum of boxes 21-26 (adjusted for private use).

**Box 32: Tax adjustments**

Any adjustments (rare for most landlords).

**Box 33: Taxable profit**

Total income (box 20) minus total expenses (box 31).

### Section 4: Finance Costs (Section 24)

**Box 44: Residential property finance costs**

Re-enter the finance costs from box 23. HMRC uses this to calculate your 20% tax credit.

**How Section 24 works:**

1. Your taxable profit (box 33) does NOT have finance costs deducted
2. HMRC calculates your tax on this profit
3. Then applies a 20% tax credit on finance costs (box 44)

## Step-by-Step Example

**Sarah: Two Buy-to-Let Properties**

**Property Income:**
| Property | Rent Received |
|----------|---------------|
| 14 Oak Lane | £12,000 |
| Flat 3, The Heights | £9,600 |
| **Total (Box 20)** | **£21,600** |

**Expenses:**
| Category | Amount | Box |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Ground rent + insurance | £650 | 21 |
| Repairs and maintenance | £1,800 | 22 |
| Mortgage interest | £8,000 | 23 |
| Letting agent fees | £2,160 | 24 |
| Cleaning | £480 | 25 |
| Travel, safety certs | £350 | 26 |
| **Total expenses (non-finance)** | **£5,440** | 31 |

**Calculation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total income | £21,600 |
| Less expenses (excluding finance) | −£5,440 |
| **Taxable profit** | **£16,160** |

**Section 24 credit:**
- Finance costs (Box 44): £8,000
- Tax credit: 20% × £8,000 = £1,600

**Sarah's tax:**
- Income Tax on £16,160 at 40% = £6,464
- Less Section 24 credit = −£1,600
- **Net property tax: £4,864**

## Multiple Properties

If you own several rental properties, they're treated as **one property business**:

| What to Combine | How |
|-----------------|-----|
| Income | Add all rental income together |
| Expenses | Add all expenses together |
| Finance costs | Add all mortgage interest together |

You complete one SA105 for all UK property income, not one per property.

**Exception:** Overseas property income goes on SA106, not SA105.

## Joint Ownership

If you own property with someone else:

### 50/50 Ownership

Each owner reports **half** the income and expenses on their own tax return.

### Unequal Ownership

By default, HMRC treats income as 50/50 for married couples/civil partners, regardless of ownership split.

To report based on actual ownership percentages:
1. Complete **Form 17** (Declaration of beneficial interests)
2. Submit to HMRC
3. Report income based on actual ownership

**Example:** You own 75%, spouse owns 25%.
- Without Form 17: Each reports 50%
- With Form 17: You report 75%, spouse reports 25%

## Losses

If your property expenses exceed income:

| Loss Situation | Treatment |
|----------------|-----------|
| Loss this year | Carry forward to future years |
| Loss from previous years | Offset against this year's profit |

Enter losses in Box 36 (or Box 37 for previous year losses used).

**Note:** Property losses can only offset property income, not other income.

## Furnished Holiday Lets (FHL)

FHL properties have different rules and a separate section on SA105.

**From April 2025:** FHL tax advantages are being removed. FHL income will be reported the same as regular residential lets.

If you have a qualifying FHL for 2024/25, use boxes 34-38 on SA105.

## Overseas Property

Overseas rental income goes on form **SA106** (Foreign), not SA105.

- Report income converted to GBP
- Claim foreign tax credit if tax paid abroad
- UK tax rules apply to UK residents

## Common Reporting Mistakes

### 1. Gross vs Net Rent

Report **gross rent** (what tenants pay), not what you receive after agent fees. Claim agent fees separately as an expense.

**Wrong:** Report £10,800 (after 10% agent fee)
**Right:** Report £12,000 income, claim £1,200 agent fee as expense

### 2. Deducting Mortgage Interest

Don't subtract mortgage interest from income. Enter it separately in Box 23/44 for the Section 24 credit.

### 3. Capital vs Revenue

Don't claim capital improvements as expenses. Only repairs and maintenance are deductible from income.

### 4. Missing Expenses

Review the [landlord expenses guide](/landlord-tax/expenses). Many landlords forget:
- Travel to properties
- Phone calls about property
- Safety certificates

### 5. Wrong Tax Year

The tax year runs 6 April to 5 April. Rent received on 1 April 2025 is in 2024/25. Rent received on 10 April 2025 is in 2025/26.
