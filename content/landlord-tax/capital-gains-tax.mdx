  - question: "How much Capital Gains Tax do landlords pay on property?"
    answer: "Landlords pay CGT at 18% (basic rate taxpayers) or 24% (higher/additional rate) on gains from residential property sales. The rate depends on your total taxable income plus the gain. The first £3,000 is tax-free (Annual Exempt Amount)."
  - question: "Do I pay CGT if I sell my buy-to-let property?"
    answer: "Yes. When you sell a rental property that isn't your main home, you pay CGT on the gain (sale price minus purchase price, costs, and improvements). You must report and pay within 60 days of completion."
  - question: "How do I reduce Capital Gains Tax on a rental property?"
    answer: "Reduce CGT by deducting purchase costs, selling costs, and capital improvements. Use your £3,000 annual exemption. Transfer to a spouse to use their exemption. Consider timing around your income tax band."
  - question: "When do I have to report and pay property CGT?"
    answer: "You must report the sale and pay CGT within 60 days of completion. Use HMRC's 'Report and pay Capital Gains Tax on UK property' service. Late reporting incurs penalties."

Landlords pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) when selling a rental property at a profit. The CGT rate on residential property is **18% for basic rate taxpayers** or **24% for higher/additional rate taxpayers**. You must report the sale and pay CGT within **60 days** of completion.

This guide explains how to calculate CGT on rental property, available reliefs, and reporting requirements.

## CGT Rates on Property 2025/26

Residential property has higher CGT rates than other assets:

| Your Tax Band | CGT Rate on Property |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Basic rate (income up to £50,270) | 18% |
| Higher rate (£50,271 – £125,140) | 24% |
| Additional rate (over £125,140) | 24% |

**Compared to other assets:** Shares and other gains are taxed at 10% (basic) or 20% (higher).

### Which Rate Do You Pay?

Your CGT rate depends on your **total taxable income plus the gain**:

1. Add your taxable income (salary, rental profit, etc.)
2. Add your capital gain
3. If the total pushes you into higher rate, pay 24% on that portion

**Example:**
- Taxable income: £40,000
- Capital gain: £30,000
- Total: £70,000
- Basic rate band remaining: £50,270 − £40,000 = £10,270
- CGT at 18%: £10,270 × 18% = £1,849
- CGT at 24%: (£30,000 − £10,270) × 24% = £4,735
- **Total CGT: £6,584**

## Annual Exempt Amount

The first **£3,000** of capital gains each tax year is tax-free (2025/26).

| Tax Year | Annual Exempt Amount |
|----------|---------------------|
| 2024/25 | £3,000 |
| 2025/26 | £3,000 |
| Previously | £12,300 (until 2023) |

**Note:** The exemption reduced significantly in recent years.

If you have gains from multiple sources, the exemption applies to your combined total, not per asset.

## Calculating Your Capital Gain

### Basic Calculation

**Capital Gain = Sale Price − Allowable Costs**

### Allowable Costs

| Cost Type | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Purchase price** | What you paid for the property |
| **Purchase costs** | Stamp duty, legal fees, survey |
| **Improvement costs** | Extensions, conversions, new kitchen (capital items) |
| **Selling costs** | Estate agent fees, legal fees, EPC |

### What You CANNOT Deduct

| Cost | Why Not Allowable |
|------|-------------------|
| Repairs and maintenance | Already claimed against rental income |
| Mortgage interest | Not a capital cost |
| Insurance | Revenue expense |
| Your time | Not a cost |

### Calculation Example

**Property Purchase (2015):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Purchase price | £200,000 |
| Stamp duty | £1,500 |
| Legal fees (purchase) | £1,200 |
| Survey | £400 |
| **Total acquisition cost** | **£203,100** |

**Improvements Made:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Loft conversion (2018) | £25,000 |
| New kitchen (upgrade, 2020) | £8,000 |
| **Total improvements** | **£33,000** |

**Sale (2025):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Sale price | £350,000 |
| Estate agent fees (1.5%) | £5,250 |
| Legal fees (sale) | £1,500 |
| **Total selling costs** | **£6,750** |

**Capital Gain:**
| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Sale price | £350,000 |
| Less: Acquisition cost | −£203,100 |
| Less: Improvements | −£33,000 |
| Less: Selling costs | −£6,750 |
| **Gross gain** | **£107,150** |
| Less: Annual exempt amount | −£3,000 |
| **Taxable gain** | **£104,150** |

**CGT at 24%:** £104,150 × 24% = **£24,996**

## Reliefs That Reduce CGT

### Private Residence Relief (PRR)

If you lived in the property as your main home for any period, you may qualify for PRR:

- **Full relief:** Main home throughout ownership = no CGT
- **Partial relief:** Lived there for some of the time = proportionate relief
- **Final 9 months:** Always exempt (even if not living there)

**Calculation:**
PRR = Gain × (Months as main home + final 9 months) ÷ Total months owned

**Example:**
- Owned: 120 months (10 years)
- Lived in as main home: 36 months (3 years)
- Final 9 months: 9 months
- Exempt: (36 + 9) ÷ 120 = 37.5%
- Taxable: 62.5% of gain

### Letting Relief

If you qualify for PRR and also let the property, additional Letting Relief may apply:

| Condition | Relief Available |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Lived in property at some point | Up to £40,000 |
| Property let as residential accommodation | Required |
| You moved out before letting | Required |

**Calculation:** Lower of:
- £40,000
- PRR amount
- Gain from letting period

**Note:** Letting Relief was restricted in 2020. It now only applies if you **shared occupancy** with the tenant (rare).

### Spouse/Civil Partner Transfers

Transfers between spouses or civil partners are CGT-free:

- Transfer property to spouse: no immediate CGT
- Spouse inherits your base cost
- Both can use their £3,000 annual exemptions
- Can move to lower-rate taxpayer before sale

**Example:** You're a higher-rate taxpayer (24% CGT). Transfer 50% to basic-rate spouse before sale. Their half is taxed at 18%.

### Losses

Capital losses offset gains:

- Losses from the same year offset gains first
- Unused losses carry forward indefinitely
- Losses must be reported to HMRC within 4 years

**Example:** You sell Property A for a £50,000 gain and Property B for a £20,000 loss.
- Net gain: £30,000
- Less annual exemption: £3,000
- Taxable: £27,000

## 60-Day Reporting Rule

Since April 2020, UK residential property sales must be reported to HMRC within **60 days** of completion.

### What to Report

| Information | Required |
|-------------|----------|
| Property address | Yes |
| Completion date | Yes |
| Sale price | Yes |
| Acquisition cost and date | Yes |
| Improvement costs | Yes |
| Calculation of gain | Yes |
| Any reliefs claimed | Yes |

### How to Report

Use HMRC's online service: [Report and pay Capital Gains Tax on UK property](https://www.gov.uk/report-and-pay-your-capital-gains-tax)

You'll need:
- Government Gateway account
- Property details
- Financial records
- Bank details for payment

### Payment Deadline

Pay CGT within **60 days** of completion—at the same time as reporting.

This is a **payment on account**. You'll finalise on your Self Assessment return, where you may owe more or receive a refund.

### Penalties for Late Reporting

| Delay | Penalty |
|-------|---------|
| Up to 6 months late | £100 |
| 6-12 months late | £300 or 5% of tax (whichever higher) |
| Over 12 months late | £300 or 5% of tax (plus potential further penalties) |

Interest also accrues on late payments.

## CGT vs Income Tax

Be clear about what's subject to CGT vs Income Tax:

| Subject to CGT | Subject to Income Tax |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Profit on selling property | Rental income |
| Value growth over time | Annual rental profit |
| One-time event at sale | Ongoing each year |

**They're separate:** You pay Income Tax on rent each year AND CGT when you sell.

## Multiple Properties

If you own several rental properties, each sale is a separate CGT calculation:

- Each property has its own base cost
- Each sale is reported within 60 days
- Your £3,000 annual exemption covers all gains combined
- Losses on one can offset gains on another

**Planning:** Consider selling one property per tax year to use each year's exemption.

## Inherited Property

If you inherited a rental property:

| Aspect | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|
| Base cost | Market value at date of death |
| Gain | Value increase since inheritance |
| PRR | Usually none (wasn't your home) |

**Example:**
- Inherited value (2020): £250,000
- Sale price (2025): £320,000
- Gain: £70,000

No CGT on the growth during the deceased's lifetime—your "acquisition cost" is the probate value.

## Reducing Your CGT Bill

### 1. Use Both Annual Exemptions

If jointly owned with spouse:
- Each has £3,000 exemption
- Combined: £6,000 tax-free

### 2. Transfer to Lower-Rate Spouse

If one spouse is a basic-rate taxpayer, transfer a share before sale to access the 18% rate.

### 3. Maximise Deductible Costs

Ensure you claim:
- All purchase costs
- All genuine improvements (not repairs)
- All selling costs

Keep records—you may own a property for decades before selling.

### 4. Time the Sale

Consider:
- Waiting until a new tax year for fresh annual exemption
- Selling in a year with lower income (lower CGT rate)
- Spreading sales across multiple years

### 5. Offset Losses

If you have other capital losses (shares, other property), offset against this gain.

### 6. Pension Contributions

Contributions reduce your taxable income, potentially keeping you in the basic rate band (18% CGT instead of 24%).

## CGT When Incorporating

If you transfer a property to a limited company:

- CGT is due as if you sold at market value
- Company acquires at market value
- Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) may also apply

**Incorporation relief** may defer CGT in some circumstances, but property businesses rarely qualify.

This is complex—seek professional advice before incorporating.

## Record Keeping for CGT

Keep for **6 years after sale** (or indefinitely if property still owned):

| Document | Why Needed |
|----------|------------|
| Purchase completion statement | Proves acquisition cost |
| Stamp duty receipt | Deductible cost |
| Legal invoices (purchase) | Deductible cost |
| Improvement invoices | Deductible capital costs |
| Sale completion statement | Proves sale price |
| Agent invoices | Deductible selling costs |
| Legal invoices (sale) | Deductible cost |

**Tip:** Scan and store digitally. Paper can be lost over decades of ownership.
