faqs:
  - question: "How much tax do landlords pay on rental income?"
    answer: "Rental profits are added to your other income and taxed at your marginal rate - 20% basic rate, 40% higher rate, or 45% additional rate. You can deduct allowable expenses before calculating your profit."
  - question: "Can landlords still claim mortgage interest?"
    answer: "Mortgage interest is no longer deductible as an expense. Instead, you receive a 20% tax credit on your mortgage interest payments, which benefits basic rate taxpayers but costs higher rate taxpayers more."
  - question: "Do I need to declare rental income under £1,000?"
    answer: "If your gross rental income is under £1,000, you can use the property income allowance and don't need to declare it. If income exceeds £1,000, you must report it through Self Assessment."
  - question: "When do I pay Capital Gains Tax on a rental property?"
    answer: "CGT is due when you sell a rental property. You must report and pay within 60 days of completion. Rates are 18% (basic rate) or 24% (higher rate) after the £3,000 annual exemption."

Being a landlord can be a great investment, but the UK tax system for rental property has become increasingly complex. This guide covers everything you need to know about landlord tax.

## How Rental Income is Taxed

Rental income is treated as unearned income and added to your other earnings. You pay Income Tax on your rental profit at your marginal rate.

### Income Tax Rates on Rental Income

| Tax Band | Income Range | Rate |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Personal Allowance | Up to £12,570 | 0% |
| Basic Rate | £12,571 - £50,270 | 20% |
| Higher Rate | £50,271 - £125,140 | 40% |
| Additional Rate | Over £125,140 | 45% |

Your rental profit is combined with employment income, self-employment, pensions, and other sources to determine your tax band.

## Calculating Your Rental Profit

**Rental Profit = Gross Rent - Allowable Expenses**

The more legitimate expenses you can claim, the less tax you pay.

### The Property Income Allowance

If your gross rental income is £1,000 or less, you can use the **property income allowance** and won't need to report it.

If income exceeds £1,000, you can either:
- Claim actual expenses (usually better if expenses are significant)
- Use the £1,000 allowance instead of claiming expenses (simpler but rarely beneficial)

You cannot use both.

## Allowable Expenses for Landlords

### Revenue Expenses (Fully Deductible)

**Property Management**
- Letting agent fees
- Property management costs
- Legal fees for short leases (under 1 year)
- Accountant fees

**Maintenance and Repairs**
- General repairs and maintenance
- Decorating between tenants
- Replacing like-for-like items (e.g., old boiler → new boiler)
- Garden maintenance

**Insurance**
- Landlord insurance
- Buildings insurance
- Contents insurance (if furnished)
- Rent guarantee insurance

**Professional Services**
- Letting agent fees
- Legal costs for tenant disputes
- Inventory costs
- Reference checking fees

**Running Costs**
- Ground rent
- Service charges
- Council tax (when empty)
- Utility bills (if you pay them)

**Other Costs**
- Advertising for tenants
- Stationery and phone calls
- Travel to the property for maintenance
- Landlord certificates (gas safety, EICR, EPC)

### What You CANNOT Claim

- Personal use of the property
- Improvements (adding value, not replacing)
- Initial purchase costs (these affect CGT instead)
- Your own labour

## Mortgage Interest: The Tax Credit System

Since April 2020, mortgage interest is no longer deductible as an expense. Instead, you receive a 20% tax credit.

### How It Works

1. Calculate your rental profit **without** deducting mortgage interest
2. Pay tax on that full profit at your marginal rate
3. Receive a 20% tax credit on your mortgage interest

### Impact by Tax Band

| Tax Band | Old System | New System | Extra Tax |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Basic (20%) | 20% relief | 20% credit | None |
| Higher (40%) | 40% relief | 20% credit | 20% extra |
| Additional (45%) | 45% relief | 20% credit | 25% extra |

### Example: Higher Rate Taxpayer

- Rental income: £20,000
- Expenses: £3,000
- Mortgage interest: £8,000

**Old System (pre-2020):**
- Profit: £20,000 - £3,000 - £8,000 = £9,000
- Tax at 40%: £3,600

**New System:**
- Profit (before interest): £17,000
- Tax at 40%: £6,800
- Tax credit (20% of £8,000): -£1,600
- **Final tax: £5,200**

The landlord pays £1,600 more per year.

## Furnished vs Unfurnished Properties

### Unfurnished Properties

You can claim:
- 10% wear and tear allowance has been **abolished**
- Replacement of domestic items relief (like-for-like only)

### Furnished Holiday Lettings (FHL)

FHL properties have special tax advantages:
- Mortgage interest **is** fully deductible
- Capital allowances on furniture
- Business asset rollover relief
- Entrepreneurs' Relief on sale (if qualifying)

**To qualify as FHL:**
- Available for let 210+ days per year
- Actually let for 105+ days per year
- Not occupied by same person for more than 31 consecutive days

## Capital Gains Tax for Landlords

When you sell a rental property, you pay CGT on the gain.

### CGT Rates for Property (2024/25)

| Rate | Applies to |
|------|-----------|
| 18% | Basic rate taxpayers |
| 24% | Higher/additional rate taxpayers |

The annual CGT exemption is £3,000 for 2024/25.

### Calculating Your Gain

**Gain = Sale Price - Purchase Price - Allowable Costs**

Allowable costs include:
- Stamp duty on purchase
- Legal and estate agent fees
- Improvement costs (but not repairs)

### 60-Day Reporting Requirement

You must report and pay CGT within **60 days** of completion when selling UK residential property. Late filing triggers penalties.

### Private Residence Relief

If the property was ever your main home, you may qualify for partial relief:
- Period as main home: Full relief
- Final 9 months: Full relief (regardless of use)
- Letting relief: Up to £40,000 if you lived there with tenants

## Reporting Rental Income

### Self Assessment

If you earn over £2,500 from property (or any amount if claiming expenses), you must file a Self Assessment tax return.

Complete the **SA105 Property Income** supplement with:
- Total rental income
- Allowable expenses by category
- Mortgage interest (for tax credit)
- Other reliefs

### Payment Dates

- **31 January** - Tax due + first payment on account
- **31 July** - Second payment on account

## Making Tax Digital for Landlords

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (income over £30,000), landlords must:

- Keep digital records
- Submit quarterly updates to HMRC
- Use MTD-compatible software

Combined income from all sources determines your threshold.

## Tax-Efficient Property Ownership

### Should You Use a Limited Company?

Buying property through a company can be more tax-efficient because:
- Mortgage interest **is** deductible for companies
- Corporation Tax (25%) vs Income Tax (40%+)
- More flexibility with profit extraction

**But consider:**
- Higher mortgage rates for companies
- Extraction costs (dividends are taxed)
- No CGT annual exemption
- Stamp duty surcharges

Generally worth considering for:
- New purchases
- Higher/additional rate taxpayers
- Growing portfolios
- Properties you won't need to access personally

### Joint Ownership

Married couples and civil partners can split property income in any proportion (not just 50/50) by making a Form 17 declaration to HMRC.

This can help if one partner:
- Doesn't use their full Personal Allowance
- Is in a lower tax band

## Common Landlord Tax Mistakes

1. **Not keeping receipts** - You need evidence for all claims
2. **Claiming improvements as repairs** - Only like-for-like counts
3. **Missing the 60-day CGT deadline** - Penalties add up quickly
4. **Forgetting mortgage interest credit** - It still saves you 20%
5. **Not tracking mileage** - Property visits are deductible
6. **Mixing personal and rental finances** - Keep separate records
