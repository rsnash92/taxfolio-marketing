faqs:
  - question: "How much can I earn tax-free from renting a room?"
    answer: "You can earn up to £7,500 per year tax-free under the Rent a Room scheme. If you share the income with a partner or co-owner, the allowance is halved to £3,750 each. This covers rent, bills, and services like meals or laundry."
  - question: "Does the Rent a Room scheme apply to Airbnb?"
    answer: "Yes, if you rent a room in your main home through Airbnb (not the whole property), the Rent a Room scheme applies. You can earn up to £7,500 tax-free. If you let the whole property, normal rental income rules apply instead."
  - question: "Do I need to tell HMRC about Rent a Room income?"
    answer: "If you earn under £7,500, you don't need to do anything—the Rent a Room scheme applies automatically. If you earn over £7,500 or want to claim expenses instead, you must file a Self Assessment tax return."
  - question: "Can I claim expenses with the Rent a Room scheme?"
    answer: "No. The Rent a Room scheme is a flat allowance—you cannot also claim expenses. However, if your expenses exceed £7,500, you can opt out and claim actual expenses instead, paying tax on the profit."

The Rent a Room scheme lets you earn up to **£7,500 tax-free** per year from renting a furnished room in your home to a lodger. The scheme applies automatically if you qualify—you don't need to register or claim it. If your rental income exceeds £7,500, you can choose to either deduct the £7,500 allowance or claim actual expenses, whichever gives you the lower tax bill.

This guide explains how the scheme works, who qualifies, and when you might want to opt out.

## How the Rent a Room Scheme Works

### The Basics

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Tax-free allowance | £7,500 per year |
| Shared with someone | £3,750 each |
| What it covers | Rent + bills + services |
| Registration required | No |
| Reporting required | No (if under £7,500) |

### Automatic Application

If you meet the conditions, the scheme applies automatically:
- You don't need to register
- You don't need to file a tax return (if under £7,500)
- You don't need to tell HMRC anything

**Only take action if:**
- Income exceeds £7,500, or
- You want to opt out and claim expenses instead

## Who Qualifies

### Eligibility Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Your home | Must be your main residence |
| Furnished room | Room must be furnished |
| In your home | Not a separate building |
| Residential let | Lodger lives there |

### Who Can Use It

| Situation | Qualifies? |
|-----------|-----------|
| Homeowner letting spare room | Yes |
| Tenant subletting (with permission) | Yes |
| Live-in landlord | Yes |
| Letting unfurnished room | No |
| Letting separate building/annex | No |
| Letting while away (not your home) | No |

### Main Residence Requirement

The property must be where you normally live:

| Scenario | Qualifies? |
|----------|-----------|
| Your primary home | Yes |
| Second home | No |
| Holiday home | No |
| Buy-to-let property | No |
| Home you've moved out of | No |

## What Counts as Income

### Included in the £7,500

| Income Type | Included? |
|-------------|----------|
| Rent payments | Yes |
| Contribution to bills | Yes |
| Payment for meals provided | Yes |
| Payment for laundry service | Yes |
| Payment for cleaning | Yes |

### Not Included

| Income Type | Included? |
|-------------|----------|
| Deposits (refundable) | No |
| Rent from separate property | No |
| Business use payments | No (different rules) |

## Shared Ownership

### Splitting the Allowance

If you share the income with someone else:

| Situation | Your Allowance |
|-----------|---------------|
| You receive all income | £7,500 |
| Shared with spouse/partner | £3,750 each |
| Shared with co-owner | £3,750 each |

### How Splitting Works

**Example: Married Couple**

| Partner | Rent Received | Allowance | Taxable |
|---------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Partner A | £4,000 | £3,750 | £250 |
| Partner B | £4,000 | £3,750 | £250 |
| **Total** | **£8,000** | **£7,500** | **£500** |

Even though total income is £8,000, the combined allowance is still £7,500.

## Income Under £7,500

### No Action Required

If your rental income is **£7,500 or less**:

| Action | Required? |
|--------|-----------|
| Register with HMRC | No |
| File Self Assessment | No |
| Pay Income Tax | No |
| Keep records | Recommended |

The scheme applies automatically—you keep all the income tax-free.

### Example: Under the Threshold

**Sarah lets her spare room:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Monthly rent | £550 |
| Annual income | £6,600 |
| Rent a Room allowance | £7,500 |
| **Tax to pay** | **£0** |

Sarah doesn't need to do anything. The income is tax-free.

## Income Over £7,500

### Two Options

If income exceeds £7,500, you must:

1. **File a Self Assessment return**, and
2. **Choose a calculation method**

| Option | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Option A: Use the allowance | Income − £7,500 = taxable |
| Option B: Claim expenses | Income − actual expenses = taxable |

### Option A: Deduct the Allowance

**Simple calculation:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Rental income | £9,000 |
| Less: Rent a Room allowance | −£7,500 |
| **Taxable income** | **£1,500** |

Use this if your expenses are less than £7,500.

### Option B: Claim Actual Expenses

**Expense-based calculation:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Rental income | £9,000 |
| Less: Expenses | −£2,000 |
| **Taxable income** | **£7,000** |

In this example, the allowance (Option A) gives a lower taxable amount—use that.

### Which Option to Choose

| Your Expenses | Best Option |
|---------------|-------------|
| Under £7,500 | Use the allowance |
| Over £7,500 | Claim expenses |

**Key point:** You cannot claim both. It's the allowance OR expenses, not both.

## Opting Out of the Scheme

### When to Opt Out

You might want to opt out if:

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| High expenses | Significant repairs or improvements |
| Creating a loss | Expenses exceed income |
| Carrying losses forward | Building tax relief for future |

### How to Opt Out

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| File Self Assessment | Report income and expenses |
| Complete property pages | SA105 supplementary pages |
| Elect to opt out | Tick the opt-out box |

### Opting Back In

If you opted out, you can opt back in for future tax years. Notify HMRC within 12 months of the end of the tax year you want to opt in for.

## Rent a Room and Other Property Income

### Interaction with BTL

The Rent a Room scheme is separate from other rental income:

| Income Source | Treatment |
|---------------|-----------|
| Lodger in your home | Rent a Room scheme |
| Buy-to-let property | Normal property income |

You can use both simultaneously for different properties.

### Example: Mixed Portfolio

| Property | Income | Treatment |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Spare room (main home) | £6,000 | Rent a Room (tax-free) |
| Buy-to-let flat | £12,000 | Property income (taxable) |

The schemes don't interact—calculate each separately.

## Rent a Room and Airbnb

### Short-Term Letting

The Rent a Room scheme can apply to Airbnb:

| Airbnb Situation | Qualifies? |
|------------------|-----------|
| Letting a room in your home | Yes |
| Letting whole home while away | No |
| Letting separate property | No |

### Example: Airbnb Room

**James lets his spare room on Airbnb:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| 60 nights at £80 | £4,800 |
| Within Rent a Room limit | Yes |
| **Tax to pay** | **£0** |

## Trading Allowance vs Rent a Room

### Which Applies?

| Allowance | For | Amount |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Trading Allowance | Self-employment income | £1,000 |
| Property Allowance | Rental income (not main home) | £1,000 |
| Rent a Room | Lodger in main home | £7,500 |

The Rent a Room scheme is separate from and more generous than the Property Allowance.

### Can You Use Multiple Allowances?

You can use both the Trading Allowance (for self-employment) and Rent a Room (for lodger income)—they cover different income types.

## Record Keeping

### Even If Tax-Free

Keep records even if income is under £7,500:

| Record | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Rental agreement | Proof of arrangement |
| Bank statements | Evidence of payments |
| Dates of letting | Duration of tenancy |

Keep for **6 years** in case HMRC queries your tax affairs.

### If Filing Self Assessment

| Record | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| All income received | Total for tax year |
| Expenses (if claiming) | Deductions from income |
| Calculation choice | Which method you used |

## Common Rent a Room Questions

### Does Council Tax Change?

Having a lodger doesn't usually affect Council Tax:

| Situation | Council Tax |
|-----------|------------|
| Lodger who isn't a joint tenant | No change |
| Sub-tenant with exclusive use | May change |
| Check with your council | Always advisable |

### What About Benefits?

Rental income may affect means-tested benefits:

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Universal Credit | Income may affect entitlement |
| Housing Benefit | Income may affect entitlement |
| Tax Credits | Income may affect calculation |

Seek advice if you receive benefits before taking a lodger.

### Does It Affect Mortgage?

Check your mortgage terms:

| Mortgage Type | Likely Position |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Standard residential | Often permits lodger |
| Buy-to-let | Lodger arrangements vary |
| Always check | Notify lender if required |

Some mortgages require you to inform the lender.

### Insurance Implications

Notify your insurer:

| Insurance | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Buildings | Inform of lodger |
| Contents | Update for lodger's possessions |
| Landlord insurance | May be required |

Non-disclosure could invalidate claims.

## Furnished Holiday Lettings

Rent a Room doesn't apply to furnished holiday lettings (FHL):

| Type | Scheme |
|------|--------|
| Lodger in main home | Rent a Room (£7,500) |
| Holiday let (whole property) | FHL rules |
| Room in home for tourists | Rent a Room may apply |

FHL has different rules and tax advantages. Learn more at HMRC's guidance on [furnished holiday lettings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/furnished-holiday-lettings-hs253-self-assessment-helpsheet).

## Making Tax Digital

### Does MTD Apply?

MTD for Income Tax applies based on your **qualifying income**:

| Your Income | MTD Applies? |
|-------------|-------------|
| Only Rent a Room (under £7,500) | No |
| Rent a Room + other self-employment over £50k | Yes (from April 2026) |
| Rent a Room + other property income over £50k | Yes (from April 2026) |

If Rent a Room is your only income and it's under £7,500, MTD won't affect you.
