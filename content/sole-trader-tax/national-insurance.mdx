faqs:
  - question: "How much National Insurance do sole traders pay?"
    answer: "Sole traders pay Class 2 NI at £3.45 per week (if profits exceed £6,725) and Class 4 NI at 6% on profits between £12,570-£50,270, then 2% above £50,270. Total NI depends on your annual profit level."
  - question: "What is the difference between Class 2 and Class 4 NI?"
    answer: "Class 2 NI is a flat weekly rate (£3.45) that provides State Pension entitlement. Class 4 NI is a percentage of profits (6%/2%) that contributes to HMRC revenue but doesn't affect your pension rights."
  - question: "Do I pay National Insurance if I'm employed and self-employed?"
    answer: "Yes, you may pay NI on both. Your employer deducts Class 1 NI from employment. You pay Class 2 and Class 4 on self-employment profits. The annual maximum limits may apply to prevent overpayment."
  - question: "Can I pay voluntary National Insurance as a sole trader?"
    answer: "If your profits are below £6,725, you can voluntarily pay Class 2 NI (£3.45/week) to maintain State Pension entitlement. This is optional but recommended to avoid gaps in your National Insurance record."

Sole traders pay **Class 2 and Class 4 National Insurance** on their profits. Class 2 is a flat weekly rate (£3.45) that counts towards your State Pension. Class 4 is a percentage of profits (6% then 2%) that goes to HMRC but doesn't add pension entitlement. Both are calculated and paid through your Self Assessment tax return.

This guide explains how sole trader National Insurance works, current rates, and how to calculate what you owe.

## National Insurance Classes for Sole Traders

### The Two Classes You Pay

| Class | Rate | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Class 2 | £3.45/week | State Pension entitlement |
| Class 4 | 6%/2% of profits | Revenue contribution |

Both are separate from the Class 1 NI that employees pay through PAYE.

### What Each Class Does

| Class | Contributes To |
|-------|----------------|
| Class 2 | State Pension, Maternity Allowance, Bereavement Support |
| Class 4 | General government revenue only |

**Important:** Class 4 doesn't count towards any benefits—only Class 2 builds your entitlements.

## Class 2 National Insurance

### Current Rate

| Period | Rate |
|--------|------|
| Weekly | £3.45 |
| Annual (52 weeks) | £179.40 |

### When You Pay Class 2

| Your Profits | Class 2 Treatment |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Over £6,725 | Mandatory (paid with tax return) |
| Under £6,725 | Voluntary (optional) |
| Under £6,725 with no payment | Risk gaps in NI record |

### Small Profits Threshold

The **Small Profits Threshold** is £6,725 for 2024/25:

| Profits | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| £6,725 or more | Must pay Class 2 |
| Under £6,725 | Can choose to pay voluntarily |

### Why Pay Voluntarily

If profits are under £6,725, paying voluntary Class 2 is recommended:

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| State Pension | Need 35 qualifying years for full pension |
| Gaps cost more later | Filling gaps retrospectively costs more |
| Low cost | Only £179.40 per year |
| Maternity Allowance | Requires NI contributions |

### How to Pay Voluntarily

Apply to pay voluntary Class 2 through your Self Assessment tax return or contact HMRC.

## Class 4 National Insurance

### Current Rates (2024/25)

| Profit Band | Rate |
|-------------|------|
| Under £12,570 | 0% |
| £12,570 – £50,270 | 6% |
| Over £50,270 | 2% |

### How Class 4 Is Calculated

Class 4 applies to profits between the lower and upper limits:

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Lower Profits Limit (LPL) | £12,570 |
| Upper Profits Limit (UPL) | £50,270 |
| Band width | £37,700 |
| Maximum at 6% | £2,262 |

### Example: Class 4 Calculation

**Profits: £35,000**

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Profits | £35,000 |
| Less: LPL | −£12,570 |
| Taxable at 6% | £22,430 |
| Class 4 NI | **£1,345.80** |

**Profits: £65,000**

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| First £12,570 | 0% = £0 |
| £12,570 to £50,270 | £37,700 × 6% = £2,262 |
| £50,270 to £65,000 | £14,730 × 2% = £294.60 |
| **Total Class 4** | **£2,556.60** |

## Total NI Calculation

### Combined Class 2 + Class 4

| Your Profits | Class 2 | Class 4 | Total NI |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| £10,000 | £179 | £0 | £179 |
| £20,000 | £179 | £446 | £625 |
| £30,000 | £179 | £1,046 | £1,225 |
| £40,000 | £179 | £1,646 | £1,825 |
| £50,000 | £179 | £2,246 | £2,425 |
| £60,000 | £179 | £2,457 | £2,636 |

### Example: Full Calculation

**Sophie: Self-Employed Consultant**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Annual profit | £42,000 |
| **Class 2** | |
| 52 weeks × £3.45 | £179.40 |
| **Class 4** | |
| (£42,000 − £12,570) × 6% | £1,765.80 |
| **Total NI** | **£1,945.20** |

## When You Pay

### Payment Through Self Assessment

NI is calculated and paid with your Self Assessment:

| Deadline | What's Due |
|----------|------------|
| 31 January | Full year's Class 2 + Class 4 |

There are no separate NI payments—it's included in your tax bill.

### Payment on Account

If your total Self Assessment bill (including NI) exceeds £1,000:

| Payment | When |
|---------|------|
| 1st payment on account | 31 January |
| 2nd payment on account | 31 July |

## Employed AND Self-Employed

### Paying Both Types of NI

If you have a day job plus self-employment:

| Source | NI Type |
|--------|---------|
| Employment | Class 1 (deducted by employer) |
| Self-employment | Class 2 + Class 4 |

You may pay NI on both income sources.

### Annual Maximum Limit

There's a maximum total NI you can pay in a year:

| Limit | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Annual maximum | Prevents excessive NI payments |
| Applies when | Employment + self-employment NI is high |

If you think you've overpaid, apply for a refund after the tax year ends.

### Example: Dual Income

**James: Employee + Weekend Freelancer**

| Income Source | Amount | NI Type |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Salary | £35,000 | Class 1 (via PAYE) |
| Freelance profit | £8,000 | Class 2 + Class 4 |

**Freelance NI:**

| Class | Calculation | Amount |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Class 2 | £3.45 × 52 | £179 |
| Class 4 | £0 (profit under £12,570) | £0 |
| **Total** | | **£179** |

James pays only Class 2 on his freelance income (profit is below Class 4 threshold).

## National Insurance and State Pension

### Building Your Pension

For full State Pension, you need **35 qualifying years** of NI contributions:

| Contributions | Pension Entitlement |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 35+ years | Full State Pension |
| 10-34 years | Proportional pension |
| Under 10 years | No State Pension |

### What Counts as a Qualifying Year

| NI Type | Counts? |
|---------|---------|
| Class 2 (self-employment) | Yes |
| Class 1 (employment) | Yes |
| Class 3 (voluntary) | Yes |
| Class 4 (self-employment) | No |

**Important:** Class 4 NI does NOT count towards your pension—only Class 2.

### Check Your Record

Check your NI record at [gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record](https://www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record):

- See how many qualifying years you have
- Identify any gaps
- Check if you can fill gaps

### Filling Gaps

If you have gaps in your NI record:

| Option | When |
|--------|------|
| Voluntary Class 2 | If self-employed with low profits |
| Voluntary Class 3 | If not working (£17.45/week) |
| Credits | If caring, ill, or receiving certain benefits |

You can usually fill gaps from the last 6 years.

| £100,000 | £179 | £3,257 | £3,436 |

## Reducing Your NI Bill

### Allowable Expenses

NI is calculated on **profit**, not income. Reducing profit reduces NI:

| Expense | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Equipment | Reduces profit |
| Software | Reduces profit |
| Home office | Reduces profit |
| Travel | Reduces profit |

Learn more: [Sole Trader Expenses Guide](/sole-trader-tax/expenses)

### Pension Contributions

Personal pension contributions reduce your Income Tax but **not** National Insurance:

| Tax Type | Pension Effect |
|----------|----------------|
| Income Tax | Reduced by pension contributions |
| Class 4 NI | NOT reduced by pension contributions |
| Class 2 NI | NOT reduced by pension contributions |

### Loss-Making Years

If you make a loss:

| Profit/Loss | NI Due |
|-------------|--------|
| Profit | Class 2 + Class 4 applies |
| Loss | No Class 4; can still pay voluntary Class 2 |

## NI Compared to Income Tax

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Income Tax | National Insurance |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Personal Allowance | £12,570 (no tax) | None for Class 4 |
| Starting threshold | £12,570 | £12,570 (Class 4) |
| Rates | 20%/40%/45% | 6%/2% |
| What it funds | General spending | Benefits and pensions |

### Combined Marginal Rates

| Profit Band | Income Tax | Class 4 NI | Combined |
|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| Under £12,570 | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| £12,570 – £50,270 | 20% | 6% | 26% |
| £50,270 – £125,140 | 40% | 2% | 42% |
| Over £125,140 | 45% | 2% | 47% |

## Common NI Questions

### Do I Pay NI in My First Year?

Yes, if your profits exceed the thresholds. NI is calculated the same way from your first year of trading.

### What If I Stop Being Self-Employed?

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Become employed | Employer deducts Class 1 |
| Stop working | Consider voluntary Class 3 for pension |
| Retire | No NI payable |

### Can I Defer Class 4?

You can apply to defer Class 4 if you're employed AND self-employed and expect to hit the annual maximum. Contact HMRC before the tax year.

### What About Directors?

Company directors pay Class 1 NI on salary (like employees), not Class 2 and Class 4. This is one reason some people incorporate.
