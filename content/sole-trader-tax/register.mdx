Registering as a sole trader with HMRC is free and takes about 10 minutes online. You register for Self Assessment at [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment), and HMRC sends your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) within 10 working days. You must register by **5 October** following the tax year you started trading.

This guide covers everything you need to know about registering as a sole trader.

## What is a Sole Trader?

A sole trader is a self-employed person who runs a business as an individual. There's no legal separation between you and your business—you're personally responsible for all business debts.

| Aspect | Sole Trader |
|--------|-------------|
| Legal status | You and business are one entity |
| Liability | Personal liability for debts |
| Registration | Free with HMRC |
| Tax return | Self Assessment |
| Accounts | Private (not filed publicly) |

Common sole trader businesses:
- Freelancers and consultants
- Tradespeople (plumbers, electricians)
- Delivery drivers (Uber, Deliveroo)
- Online sellers (eBay, Etsy)
- Tutors and coaches
- Photographers and designers

## When to Register

### Registration Deadline

Register by **5 October** following the end of the tax year you started trading:

| When You Started | Tax Year | Registration Deadline |
|------------------|----------|----------------------|
| 6 April 2024 – 5 April 2025 | 2024/25 | 5 October 2025 |
| 6 April 2025 – 5 April 2026 | 2025/26 | 5 October 2026 |

### Can I Register Early?

Yes. You can register as soon as you know you'll be self-employed—even before your first job. Early registration is helpful for:

- Getting your UTR sooner

**What happens next:**

- Self Assessment is added to your Government Gateway account

## Getting Your UTR

### What is a UTR?

A **Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)** is your 10-digit tax identification number. Example: 1234567890

### When It Arrives

HMRC posts your UTR within **10 working days** of registration. The letter includes:
- Your 10-digit UTR
- Instructions for filing
- Important deadlines

### If It Doesn't Arrive

After 15 working days with no letter:

1. **Check your post** carefully
2. **Sign in online** — UTR sometimes appears before the letter
3. **Call HMRC** — 0300 200 3310 (you'll need to verify identity)

### Finding Your UTR Later

| Where to Look | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| HMRC letters | Any Self Assessment correspondence |
| Government Gateway | Sign in to your tax account |
| Previous tax returns | On SA302 or submitted returns |
| Your accountant | If you've used one |

## After Registration: Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Online Access

Link your UTR to your Government Gateway account:

1. Sign in at [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services)
2. Select "Add Self Assessment"
3. Enter your UTR
4. HMRC may post an activation code (another 7-10 days)

### 2. Open a Business Bank Account

While not legally required, a separate account makes life easier:

- Clear separation of business/personal
- Easier record-keeping
- Simpler expense tracking
- Professional image

Many banks offer free business accounts: Starling, Tide, Mettle, Monzo Business.

### 3. Start Keeping Records

From day one, track:

| Record | Why |
|--------|-----|
| All income | Know what to report |
| All expenses | Reduce your tax bill |
| Bank statements | Proof of transactions |
| Receipts | Evidence for claims |
| Mileage | If claiming vehicle costs |

Keep records for **6 years** after the tax year.

### 4. Choose Accounting Software

Options for sole traders:

| Software | Price | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| TaxFolio | From £69.99/year | Tax-focused, MTD-ready |
| FreeAgent | From £14.50/month | Invoicing + accounting |
| QuickBooks | From £12/month | Established brand |
| Spreadsheet | Free | Very simple businesses |

### 5. Understand Your Tax Obligations

As a sole trader, you'll pay:

**Income Tax** on profits:
| Band | Rate |
|------|------|
| £0 – £12,570 | 0% |
| £12,571 – £50,270 | 20% |
| £50,271 – £125,140 | 40% |
| Over £125,140 | 45% |

**National Insurance:**
- Class 2: £3.45/week (profits over £6,725)
- Class 4: 6% on £12,570-£50,270, 2% above

### 6. Set Aside Money for Tax

A common mistake: spending all your income, then struggling when tax is due.

**Rule of thumb:** Set aside **25-30% of profits** for tax.

Open a separate savings account just for tax money.

## Choosing a Business Name

### Your Options

1. **Your own name** — Sarah Jones
2. **Your name + description** — Sarah Jones Design
3. **A trading name** — Bright Ideas Design Studio

### Rules for Trading Names

- **Cannot include:** "Limited", "Ltd", "LLP", or "PLC" (these suggest a company)
- **Cannot be:** offensive or misleading
- **Can include:** most other words

### Using a Trading Name

If using a name different from your own:
- Display your real name on invoices and letters
- Display it at business premises (if applicable)
- You don't need to register the name anywhere

**Example Invoice:**
> **Bright Ideas Design Studio**
> Trading name of Sarah Jones
> 14 High Street, London

## Sole Trader vs Other Options

### Sole Trader vs Limited Company

| Factor | Sole Trader | Limited Company |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Setup cost | Free | ~£50-100 |
| Complexity | Simple | More admin |
| Tax (lower profits) | Often lower | Often higher |
| Tax (higher profits) | Often higher | Often lower |
| Liability | Personal | Limited to company |
| Privacy | Private | Public accounts |

Consider a limited company if profits regularly exceed £40,000-50,000.

### Sole Trader vs Partnership

If working with others:
- **Partnership:** Share profits and losses, joint liability
- **Limited company:** Separate legal entity, share ownership

Sole trader is for individuals only.

## Common Registration Questions

### Do I need permission to be a sole trader?

No general permission needed. But some trades require:
- Licences (e.g., taxi driving, food handling)
- Professional registration (e.g., gas safe, financial adviser)
- Insurance (e.g., professional indemnity)

### Can I be employed AND a sole trader?

Yes. Many people have a day job plus self-employment. You'll:
- Pay PAYE tax on employment income
- Pay Self Assessment on self-employment profits
- File an annual Self Assessment return covering both

### Can I register from abroad?

If you're a UK resident working abroad, or a non-resident with UK self-employment:
- Registration process is similar
- Additional rules may apply
- Consider seeking specialist advice

### What if I stop being self-employed?

If you stop trading:
1. File your final Self Assessment return
2. Tell HMRC you're no longer self-employed
3. They'll close your Self Assessment record
