  - question: "Do I have to pay tax on my side hustle?"
    answer: "If your side hustle income exceeds £1,000 per year, yes. You must register for Self Assessment and pay Income Tax on profits. Under £1,000, the Trading Allowance covers it tax-free with no need to register."
  - question: "How much can I earn from a side hustle before paying tax?"
    answer: "You can earn up to £1,000 tax-free under the Trading Allowance. Above £1,000, you either deduct the £1,000 allowance or claim actual expenses—whichever gives lower taxable profit."
  - question: "Do I need to tell HMRC about my side hustle?"
    answer: "Only if you earn over £1,000. Under £1,000, the Trading Allowance means you don't need to register or report. Over £1,000, register for Self Assessment and file a tax return by 31 January."
  - question: "How is side hustle income taxed alongside my job?"
    answer: "Side hustle profit is added to your employment income. You pay tax at your marginal rate—if your day job uses your Personal Allowance and basic rate band, side hustle income may be taxed at 40% if it pushes you into higher rate."

Side hustle income is taxable if it exceeds **£1,000 per year**. The Trading Allowance covers small amounts tax-free—you don't need to register or report income under this threshold. Above £1,000, register for Self Assessment and pay Income Tax on your profits (after deducting expenses).

This guide explains when side hustle income is taxable, how to report it, and what you can claim.

## The £1,000 Trading Allowance

The Trading Allowance gives you **£1,000 tax-free** from self-employment or trading income each year.

| Side Hustle Income | Tax Treatment |
|-------------------|---------------|
| £1,000 or less | Tax-free—no action needed |
| Over £1,000 | Register for Self Assessment |

### What Counts as Side Hustle Income?

| Included | Not Included |
|----------|--------------|
| Freelance work | Employment income (PAYE) |
| Selling products you make | Selling personal items (occasional) |
| Tutoring or coaching | Rental income (separate £1,000 allowance) |
| Gig economy work | Investment income |
| Online services | Gifts |

### Using the Allowance

If income is **under £1,000:**
- No need to register for Self Assessment
- No need to report to HMRC
- Tax-free—keep any profit

If income is **over £1,000:**
- Register for Self Assessment
- Choose: deduct £1,000 OR claim actual expenses
- Pay tax on the remainder

## Side Hustle Plus Day Job

Most side hustlers have employment income too. Here's how the tax works together:

### How It's Combined

| Source | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|
| Day job salary | Taxed via PAYE (employer deducts) |
| Side hustle profit | Added to salary, taxed via Self Assessment |

Your side hustle profit is added **on top** of employment income.

### Tax Rate on Side Hustle

Your side hustle is taxed at your **marginal rate**:

| Your Total Income | Side Hustle Tax Rate |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Under £12,570 | 0% |
| £12,571 – £50,270 | 20% |
| £50,271 – £125,140 | 40% |
| Over £125,140 | 45% |

**Example:**

| Income Source | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| Day job salary | £38,000 |
| Side hustle profit | £8,000 |
| **Total** | **£46,000** |

Your salary uses your Personal Allowance (£12,570) and part of the basic rate band. Your side hustle is taxed entirely at 20% (you're still in basic rate).

**Higher earner example:**

| Income Source | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| Day job salary | £48,000 |
| Side hustle profit | £6,000 |
| **Total** | **£54,000** |

- Basic rate band ends at £50,270
- First £2,270 of side hustle at 20% = £454
- Remaining £3,730 at 40% = £1,492
- **Tax on side hustle: £1,946**

## When to Register

### Register If:

- Side hustle income exceeds £1,000, OR
- You want to claim expenses (even if under £1,000), OR
- You have a loss you want to offset

### Don't Need to Register If:

- Income is £1,000 or less, AND
- You're happy using the Trading Allowance (no expense claims)

### How to Register

1. Go to [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment)
2. Select "Self-employed or sole trader"
3. Describe your side hustle
4. Receive your UTR in 10 working days

**Deadline:** Register by 5 October following the tax year.

## Side Hustle Expenses

If your income exceeds £1,000, you can claim expenses to reduce taxable profit.

### Common Side Hustle Expenses

| Expense | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Equipment | Laptop, camera, tools |
| Software | Apps, subscriptions |
| Materials | Supplies for products you make |
| Marketing | Website, ads, business cards |
| Phone | Business portion of contract |
| Home office | Simplified expenses (£10-26/month) |
| Travel | To clients or for business |
| Fees | Platform fees (Etsy, eBay, etc.) |

### Allowance vs Expenses

Compare both methods:

**Example: Etsy Seller**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Income | £3,500 |
| Materials | £800 |
| Etsy fees | £400 |
| Packaging/postage | £300 |
| **Total expenses** | **£1,500** |

**Option A (Trading Allowance):**
£3,500 − £1,000 = £2,500 taxable

**Option B (Actual Expenses):**
£3,500 − £1,500 = £2,000 taxable

**Best choice:** Actual expenses (saves £100 in taxable income)

## Calculating Side Hustle Tax

### Step 1: Calculate Profit

**Profit = Income − Expenses** (or Income − £1,000 allowance)

### Step 2: Add to Employment Income

**Total income = Salary + Side hustle profit**

### Step 3: Calculate Additional Tax

Tax on side hustle at your marginal rate, plus National Insurance if total self-employment profit exceeds thresholds.

### Example Calculation

**Emma: Marketing Manager with Etsy Shop**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Day job salary | £42,000 |
| Etsy sales | £8,500 |
| Etsy expenses | £3,200 |
| **Side hustle profit** | **£5,300** |
| **Total income** | **£47,300** |

**Tax on Side Hustle:**

| Tax | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Income Tax | £5,300 × 20% | £1,060 |
| Class 2 NI | £3.45 × 52 | £179 |
| Class 4 NI | 6% × £5,300 | £318 |
| **Total** | | **£1,557** |

Emma's side hustle costs £1,557 in tax—leaving her £3,743 extra income.

## National Insurance on Side Hustles

Self-employment NI applies to side hustle profit:

| Type | Rate | Threshold |
|------|------|-----------|
| Class 2 | £3.45/week | Profits over £6,725 |
| Class 4 | 6% | £12,570 – £50,270 |
| Class 4 | 2% | Over £50,270 |

**Note:** Class 4 NI only applies to the self-employment portion, not your employment salary (which has its own NI via PAYE).

## Filing Your Tax Return

### What to Include

| Section | Information |
|---------|-------------|
| Employment (if applicable) | P60 details (pre-filled by HMRC) |
| Self-employment (SA103) | Side hustle income and expenses |

### Deadline

**31 January** following the tax year.

For 2024/25 (April 2024 – April 2025): file by **31 January 2026**.

### Payment

Pay any tax owed by **31 January**.

If tax bill exceeds £1,000, you'll also make payments on account for next year.

## Record Keeping

Even for a small side hustle, keep records:

| Record | Keep For |
|--------|----------|
| Income evidence | Bank statements, platform payouts |
| Expense receipts | All business purchases |
| Mileage log | If claiming travel |

Keep for **6 years** after the tax year.

## Common Side Hustle Mistakes

### 1. Not Tracking Income

If you receive money through multiple channels (PayPal, bank transfers, cash), track it all.

### 2. Missing Expenses

Review what you can claim. Many side hustlers under-claim.

### 3. Forgetting Platform Fees

If eBay, Etsy, or other platforms take fees, claim them as expenses.

### 4. Confusing Hobby vs Business

If you intend to make profit and work at it regularly, it's a business—even if you enjoy it.

### 5. Missing Registration Deadline

If income exceeds £1,000, register by 5 October. Late registration can cause problems.

## Side Hustle Tax Tips

### 1. Track From Day One

Even if you're unsure if you'll hit £1,000, track income and expenses from the start.

### 2. Open a Separate Bank Account

Makes tracking business transactions much easier.

### 3. Set Money Aside

Keep **25-30%** of profits for tax. Don't spend it all.

### 4. Claim Everything Legitimate

Understand allowable expenses. Every pound reduces taxable profit.

### 5. Consider Timing

If you're close to a tax band threshold, timing income or expenses around 5 April can help.

## Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital) applies.

If your **combined** self-employment and property income exceeds these thresholds, MTD applies—even if it's a side hustle.

Most side hustlers won't hit these limits, but be aware if your income grows.
