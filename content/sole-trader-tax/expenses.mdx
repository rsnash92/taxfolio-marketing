  - question: "What expenses can I claim as a sole trader?"
    answer: "You can claim expenses wholly and exclusively for business: office costs, travel and mileage, professional fees, marketing, equipment, phone and internet (business portion), home office costs, insurance, and bank charges. Keep receipts for all claims."
  - question: "Can I claim for food as a sole trader?"
    answer: "Generally no. Daily meals are personal expenses. You can only claim subsistence when travelling overnight for business, and only reasonable costs for food you wouldn't otherwise have bought."
  - question: "Can I claim clothing as a business expense?"
    answer: "Only protective clothing (safety boots, hard hats) or uniforms with permanent business branding. Ordinary clothes worn for work—even suits—are not allowable because they could be worn personally."
  - question: "Do I need receipts for all expenses?"
    answer: "Yes. HMRC requires evidence for all expense claims. Keep receipts, invoices, and bank statements for 6 years. For mileage, keep a log of business journeys. Digital records (photos, software) are acceptable."

Sole trader expenses reduce your taxable profit and lower your tax bill. You can claim any costs that are "wholly and exclusively" for business purposes. Common allowable expenses include office costs, travel, professional fees, equipment, and home office costs.

This guide lists all the expenses you can claim as a self-employed sole trader, with examples and limits.

## The "Wholly and Exclusively" Rule

HMRC's rule for allowable expenses: costs must be incurred **wholly and exclusively** for business purposes.

| Allowable | Not Allowable |
|-----------|---------------|
| Business phone contract | Personal phone (unless claiming business %) |
| Client meeting travel | Commuting to regular workplace |
| Office desk for home office | Living room furniture |
| Accountant fees | Personal tax advice |
| Trade magazine subscription | General newspaper |

**Mixed use:** If something is used for both business and personal (like a phone), claim only the business proportion.

## Office and Administrative Costs

|---------|------------|

**Calculating business percentage:** Estimate the proportion used for business. If you use your phone 60% for work, claim 60% of the contract cost.

## Travel and Transport

| Miles Per Year | Rate |
|----------------|------|
| First 10,000 | 45p per mile |

This rate covers fuel, insurance, repairs, and depreciation—you cannot claim these separately if using mileage rates.

**What counts as business mileage:**
- Travel to client sites
- Travel to temporary workplaces
- Travel between business locations
- Bank visits for business banking
- Supplier visits

**NOT business mileage:**
- Home to regular workplace (commuting)

These may reduce Capital Gains Tax when you sell, but aren't deductible from income.

## Record Keeping for Expenses

### What to Keep

For each expense, retain:
- Receipt or invoice
- Proof of payment (bank statement)
- Date of expense
- What it was for (business purpose)

### How Long to Keep Records

Keep all expense records for **6 years** after the tax year they relate to.

### Digital vs Paper

Both acceptable. Digital is easier:
- Photograph receipts immediately
- Store in cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Use accounting software with receipt capture
- Original can fade; digital lasts

## Expense Categories for Self Assessment

When filing SA103, expenses are grouped:

| Category | What to Include |
|----------|-----------------|
| Cost of goods sold | Materials, stock, subcontractors |
| Car, van, travel | Mileage OR actual vehicle costs |
| Wages, salaries | Staff costs |
| Rent, rates, power | Business premises costs |
| Repairs | Maintaining equipment/premises |
| Telephone | Phone and broadband |
| Accountancy | Professional fees |
| Bank charges | Financial costs |
| Interest | Loan interest |
| Other expenses | Anything else allowable |

TaxFolio categorises your expenses automatically into these groups.

## Common Expense Mistakes

### 1. Not Claiming Legitimate Expenses

Many sole traders under-claim. Review this list—are you missing anything?

### 2. Claiming Personal Expenses

HMRC can investigate. Only claim genuine business costs.

### 3. No Receipts

Without evidence, HMRC can disallow claims. Keep everything.

### 4. Wrong Proportions

If claiming business % of mixed-use items, be able to justify the split.

### 5. Claiming Mileage AND Car Costs

Choose one method: mileage rates OR actual costs. Not both.
