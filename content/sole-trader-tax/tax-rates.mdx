This guide covers current tax rates, National Insurance, and how to calculate your sole trader tax bill.

## Income Tax Rates 2025/26

Income Tax applies to your **taxable profit** (income minus allowable expenses):

| Band | Taxable Income | Rate |
|------|----------------|------|
| Personal Allowance | £0 – £12,570 | 0% |
| Basic Rate | £12,571 – £50,270 | 20% |
| Higher Rate | £50,271 – £125,140 | 40% |
| Additional Rate | Over £125,140 | 45% |

### Personal Allowance

The **Personal Allowance** is the amount you can earn tax-free each year. For 2025/26, it's **£12,570**.

**Important:** If your total income exceeds £100,000, your Personal Allowance reduces by £1 for every £2 above £100,000. It disappears entirely at £125,140.

| Total Income | Personal Allowance |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Up to £100,000 | £12,570 |
| £110,000 | £7,570 |
| £120,000 | £2,570 |
| £125,140+ | £0 |

### Tax Band Calculation

Your self-employment profit is added to any other income (employment, rental, etc.) to determine your tax band.

**Example:** You earn £20,000 from employment and £25,000 profit from self-employment.
- Total income: £45,000
- Personal Allowance used by employment
- All self-employment profit taxed at 20% basic rate

## National Insurance Rates 2025/26

Sole traders pay two classes of National Insurance:

### Class 2 National Insurance

| Threshold | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| Profits over £6,725/year | £3.45 per week |

**Annual cost:** £3.45 × 52 = **£179.40**

Class 2 NI counts towards your State Pension entitlement. If profits are below £6,725, you can pay voluntarily to protect your pension record.

### Class 4 National Insurance

| Profit Band | Rate |
|-------------|------|
| £12,570 – £50,270 | 6% |
| Over £50,270 | 2% |

Class 4 NI is paid through your Self Assessment tax return.

### NI Calculation Example

**Profit: £40,000**

| NI Type | Calculation | Amount |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Class 2 | £3.45 × 52 weeks | £179.40 |
| Class 4 | 6% × (£40,000 − £12,570) | £1,645.80 |
| **Total NI** | | **£1,825.20** |

| £20,000 | £1,486 | £625 | £2,111 | 10.6% |

*Assumes no other income and full Personal Allowance where applicable.*

## The £100,000 Trap

When income exceeds £100,000, you lose £1 of Personal Allowance for every £2 earned above this threshold. This creates an effective **60% marginal tax rate** between £100,000 and £125,140.

| Income | Personal Allowance Lost | Extra Tax |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| £100,000 | £0 | — |
| £105,000 | £2,500 | £1,000 |
| £110,000 | £5,000 | £2,000 |
| £125,140 | £12,570 | £5,028 |

**Planning tip:** If income is just over £100,000, consider:
- Increasing pension contributions (reduces taxable income)
- Timing expenses to reduce profit
- Deferring income to a future year

## Payment Dates

### When Tax is Due

| Deadline | What's Due |
|----------|------------|
| 31 January | Tax for previous year + first payment on account |
| 31 July | Second payment on account |

### Payments on Account

If your tax bill exceeds £1,000 (and less than 80% was deducted at source), you must make **payments on account**—advance payments toward next year's tax.

Each payment on account = **50% of previous year's bill**

**Example:**
- 2024/25 tax bill: £6,000
- 31 January 2026: Pay £6,000 (24/25 bill) + £3,000 (first POA for 25/26)
- 31 July 2026: Pay £3,000 (second POA for 25/26)

**First year surprise:** Your first Self Assessment payment includes the full year's tax PLUS 50% payment on account. Budget accordingly.

### Reducing Payments on Account

If you expect to earn less next year, you can [reduce payments on account](https://www.gov.uk/understand-self-assessment-bill/payments-on-account) through your HMRC online account. Be careful—underestimate and you'll owe interest.

## Reducing Your Tax Bill

### 1. Claim All Allowable Expenses

Many sole traders under-claim. Common missed expenses:
- Home office costs
- Phone and internet (business portion)
- Professional subscriptions
- Training courses
- Mileage

Learn more: [Sole Trader Expenses Guide](/sole-trader-tax/expenses)

### 2. Pension Contributions

Contributions to a personal pension:
- Reduce your taxable income
- Receive 20% tax relief automatically
- Higher rate taxpayers claim additional 20% via Self Assessment

**Example:** Contribute £4,000, receive £5,000 in your pension (£1,000 tax relief). If higher rate taxpayer, claim another £1,000 on your return.

### 3. Use Your Personal Allowance

If you have a spouse who earns less than £12,570:
- Pay them for legitimate work in your business
- Up to £12,570 is tax-free for them
- Reduces your taxable profit

The work must be genuine and payment reasonable for the role.

### 4. Capital Allowances

Buy equipment before your year-end to reduce this year's profit. The Annual Investment Allowance gives 100% relief on qualifying purchases up to £1 million.

### 5. Time Income and Expenses

If you're near a tax band threshold:
- Delay invoicing to push income to next year
- Bring forward expenses to claim this year
- Make pension contributions before year-end

## Comparing to Employment

How does sole trader tax compare to being employed?

| Factor | Sole Trader | Employee |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Income Tax rates | Same (20/40/45%) | Same |
| National Insurance | Class 2 + Class 4 | Class 1 (8%) |
| Employer's NI | None (you're not an employer) | Employer pays 13.8% |
| Expenses | Can claim against profit | Limited claims |
| Payment timing | Twice yearly | Monthly via PAYE |

**Key difference:** Employees pay 8% Class 1 NI (up to £50,270), while sole traders pay 6% Class 4 NI—slightly less. However, sole traders must manage their own tax payments.

## Scottish Income Tax Rates

If you live in Scotland, different Income Tax rates apply:

| Band | Taxable Income | Rate |
|------|----------------|------|
| Personal Allowance | £0 – £12,570 | 0% |
| Starter Rate | £12,571 – £14,876 | 19% |
| Basic Rate | £14,877 – £26,561 | 20% |
| Intermediate Rate | £26,562 – £43,662 | 21% |
| Higher Rate | £43,663 – £75,000 | 42% |
| Advanced Rate | £75,001 – £125,140 | 45% |
| Top Rate | Over £125,140 | 48% |

National Insurance rates are the same across the UK.

## Future Changes

### Frozen Thresholds

The Personal Allowance (£12,570) and basic rate threshold (£50,270) are frozen until April 2028. As wages rise with inflation, more people move into higher tax bands—known as "fiscal drag."

### Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), sole traders must comply with [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital):
- Digital record-keeping
