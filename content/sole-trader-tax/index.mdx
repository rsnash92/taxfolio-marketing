Being a sole trader is the simplest way to run a business in the UK. You keep all the profits, but you're also personally responsible for your business debts and tax obligations.

## What is a Sole Trader?

A sole trader is a self-employed person who owns and runs their own business. Unlike a limited company, there's no legal distinction between you and your business.

Common sole traders include:

- Freelancers and consultants
- Tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, builders)
- Photographers and creatives
- Tutors and coaches
- Delivery drivers
- Online sellers

## How Sole Trader Tax Works

As a sole trader, you pay:

1. **Income Tax** on your profits
2. **Class 2 National Insurance** (flat rate)
3. **Class 4 National Insurance** (percentage of profits)

Your profit is your income minus allowable expenses.

### Income Tax Rates 2024/25

| Band | Taxable Income | Rate |
|------|---------------|------|
| Personal Allowance | £0 - £12,570 | 0% |
| Basic Rate | £12,571 - £50,270 | 20% |
| Higher Rate | £50,271 - £125,140 | 40% |
| Additional Rate | Over £125,140 | 45% |

Your Personal Allowance reduces by £1 for every £2 earned over £100,000.

### National Insurance Rates 2024/25

**Class 2 NI**
- Rate: £3.45 per week
- Threshold: Profits over £6,725/year
- Payment: Through Self Assessment

**Class 4 NI**
- 6% on profits between £12,570 and £50,270
- 2% on profits over £50,270

## Getting Started as a Sole Trader

### Step 1: Register with HMRC

You must register for Self Assessment by **5 October** following the tax year you started trading.

To register:
1. Go to gov.uk
2. Create a Government Gateway account
3. Register for Self Assessment as self-employed
4. You'll receive your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)

### Step 2: Keep Records

From day one, you must keep records of:
- All sales and income
- All business expenses
- Bank statements
- Invoices (sent and received)
- Receipts

Records must be kept for **6 years** after the relevant tax year.

### Step 3: Track Your Profits

Your taxable profit is:

**Income - Allowable Expenses = Profit**

The more legitimate expenses you claim, the less tax you pay.

## Allowable Expenses for Sole Traders

You can deduct expenses that are "wholly and exclusively" for business purposes.

### Office and Premises

- Rent and business rates
- Utilities (business proportion)
- Office furniture and equipment
- Stationery and postage
- Phone and broadband (business use)

### Working From Home

If you work from home, you can claim:

**Option 1: Simplified expenses**
| Hours worked from home per month | Flat rate per month |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| 25-50 hours | £10 |
| 51-100 hours | £18 |
| 101+ hours | £26 |

**Option 2: Actual costs**
Calculate the business proportion of:
- Mortgage interest or rent
- Council tax
- Utilities
- Insurance

### Travel

- Business mileage (45p/mile for first 10,000 miles, 25p after)
- Public transport for business trips
- Parking and tolls
- Accommodation for business trips

**Not allowed:** Commuting to a regular workplace

### Professional Costs

- Accountant fees
- Legal costs for business matters
- Professional subscriptions and memberships
- Training directly related to your business

### Marketing and Sales

- Website hosting and domains
- Advertising and promotion
- Business cards and brochures
- Trade show attendance

### Financial Costs

- Bank charges on business accounts
- Interest on business loans
- Credit card fees
- Insurance (public liability, professional indemnity)

### Equipment and Tools

- Computers and software
- Tools of your trade
- Office furniture
- Vehicles (business use proportion)

For expensive items, you may need to claim capital allowances rather than deducting the full cost.

## Tax Calculation Example

**Sarah the Freelance Designer**

Income: £45,000
Expenses: £8,000
Profit: £37,000

**Income Tax:**
- First £12,570: £0
- £12,571 - £37,000 (£24,430): £4,886 (20%)
- **Total Income Tax: £4,886**

**National Insurance:**
- Class 2: £179.40 (52 weeks × £3.45)
- Class 4: £1,465.80 (6% of £24,430)
- **Total NI: £1,645.20**

**Total Tax Bill: £6,531.20**

Effective tax rate: 17.7%

## Reducing Your Tax Bill

### 1. Claim All Legitimate Expenses

Many sole traders under-claim. Review your spending for:
- Software subscriptions
- Phone bills
- Home office costs
- Professional development
- Travel you forgot to log

### 2. Use Your Personal Allowance

If you have a spouse who doesn't use their full Personal Allowance, consider:
- Paying them a salary for legitimate work
- Sharing property income (for landlords)

### 3. Pension Contributions

Payments into a personal pension:
- Reduce your taxable income
- Get 20% tax relief automatically
- Higher rate taxpayers claim extra 20% through Self Assessment

### 4. Consider Timing

If you're near a tax threshold, timing income or expenses can help:
- Delay invoicing to push income to next year
- Bring forward expenses to claim this year

### 5. Capital Allowances

The Annual Investment Allowance lets you deduct 100% of qualifying equipment purchases up to £1 million per year.

## When to Consider Incorporating

Some sole traders benefit from becoming a limited company:

**Consider incorporating if:**
- Profits consistently exceed £40,000-50,000
- You want to retain profits in the business
- You need limited liability protection
- You're looking to bring in investors

**Stay as a sole trader if:**
- Profits are lower
- You want simplicity
- You need flexible access to profits
- Privacy isn't a concern (company accounts are public)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Mixing personal and business finances** - Use a separate bank account
2. **Not tracking cash expenses** - Keep all receipts
3. **Missing the registration deadline** - Register by 5 October
4. **Forgetting to save for tax** - Set aside 25-30% of profits
5. **Not claiming legitimate expenses** - Review thoroughly
6. **Missing payment deadlines** - Set calendar reminders
