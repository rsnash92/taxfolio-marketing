Registering for Self Assessment with HMRC gives you a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) number, which you need to file tax returns and pay tax on self-employment income, rental income, or other untaxed earnings. Register online at [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment) by **5 October** following the tax year you need to file for.

This guide walks you through the registration process step by step.

## When to Register

### Registration Deadline

Register by **5 October** following the end of the tax year in which you started earning taxable income:

| April 2025 – April 2026 | 2025/26 | 5 October 2026 | 31 January 2027 |

You'll use your UTR for:

### When Your UTR Arrives

HMRC posts your UTR within 10 working days. The letter includes:

- Your 10-digit UTR
- Instructions for filing
- Deadline reminders
- How to access your online account

### If Your UTR Doesn't Arrive

If you haven't received your UTR after 15 working days:

1. **Check your post** — including any forwarded mail
2. **Call HMRC** — Self Assessment helpline: 0300 200 3310
3. **Check online** — Your UTR may appear in Government Gateway before the letter arrives

### Finding a Lost UTR

If you registered previously but lost your UTR:

| Where to Find It | How |
|------------------|-----|
| Previous tax returns | On your SA302 or submitted return |

Go to [gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services)

Sign in with your Government Gateway credentials.

4. Complete verification

### Step 3: Activate Your Account

HMRC may post an **activation code** (separate from your UTR):

2. Sign in to Government Gateway
3. Enter the activation code when prompted
4. Your Self Assessment account is now active

## Registration Scenarios

**Sarah started freelancing in September 2024**

1. Tax year: 2024/25
2. Registration deadline: 5 October 2025
3. Filing deadline: 31 January 2026

Sarah registers in October 2024 (early), receives her UTR in November 2024, and has plenty of time to prepare for filing.

### Scenario 2: New Landlord

1. Tax year: 2024/25 (rental started within this year)
2. Registration deadline: 5 October 2025

Emma registers as "not self-employed" and indicates she's a company director.

### Scenario 4: Multiple Income Sources

**Tom is self-employed AND has rental income**

Tom can register for both in one process:
1. Register as self-employed
2. Answer "Yes" when asked about rental income
3. Provide details for both businesses

Both income sources will be included on his Self Assessment return.

## Late Registration

### Penalties for Late Registration

If you register late and subsequently file late:

| Delay | Penalty |
|-------|---------|
| Up to 3 months late | £100 |
| 3-6 months late | £100 + £10/day (max £900) |
| 6-12 months late | Greater of £300 or 5% of tax |
| Over 12 months | Additional £300 or 5% |

**Note:** The penalty is for late **filing**, not late registration. But late registration often leads to late filing.

### If You Should Have Registered Earlier

If you missed a previous year's deadline:

1. Register as soon as possible
2. File outstanding returns immediately
3. Pay any tax owed plus interest
4. Contact HMRC if you have a reasonable excuse

HMRC may reduce penalties for voluntary disclosure.

## Registering for Partners and Directors

### Partnership Registration

If you're a partner in a business:

1. The partnership must register separately (form SA400)
2. Each partner must register individually for Self Assessment
3. Partners receive their own UTRs
4. Partnership files a partnership return; partners file individual returns

### Director Registration

Company directors register as individuals:

1. Select "Not self-employed"
2. Indicate you're a company director
3. Provide company details
4. Report salary and dividends on your return

## Registration and Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000):

- Self Assessment registration remains the same
- You'll also need MTD-compatible software
- Your UTR is still used for MTD submissions
- Quarterly reporting adds to (doesn't replace) your existing obligations

If you're registering now and expect to fall under MTD:

1. Register for Self Assessment as normal
2. Choose MTD-compatible software
3. You'll be ready for both systems

## Common Registration Questions

### Can I register by phone?

- Setting up accounting software

### What if I stop being self-employed?

Tell HMRC to close your Self Assessment record:
1. File your final return
