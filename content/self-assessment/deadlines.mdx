The Self Assessment deadline for online tax returns is **31 January** following the end of the tax year. For the 2024/25 tax year (6 April 2024 – 5 April 2025), file your online return and pay any tax owed by **31 January 2026**. Missing this deadline triggers automatic penalties starting at £100.

This guide lists all key Self Assessment dates and what happens if you're late.

## Key Deadlines for 2024/25 Tax Year

| Date | Deadline |
|------|----------|
| **5 October 2025** | Register for Self Assessment (if new) |
| **31 October 2025** | Paper tax return deadline |
| **30 December 2025** | File online to have tax collected via PAYE (if under £3,000 owed) |
| **31 January 2026** | Online tax return deadline |
| **31 January 2026** | Pay tax owed for 2024/25 |
| **31 January 2026** | First payment on account for 2025/26 |
| **31 July 2026** | Second payment on account for 2025/26 |

## Understanding the Tax Year

The UK tax year runs from **6 April to 5 April**:

| Tax Year | Period | Filing Deadline |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 2023/24 | 6 Apr 2023 – 5 Apr 2024 | 31 Jan 2025 |
| 2024/25 | 6 Apr 2024 – 5 Apr 2025 | 31 Jan 2026 |
| 2025/26 | 6 Apr 2025 – 5 Apr 2026 | 31 Jan 2027 |

You always file for the **previous** tax year. In January 2026, you're filing for income earned between April 2024 and April 2025.

## Registration Deadline

### 5 October

If you need to file Self Assessment for the first time, register with HMRC by **5 October** following the tax year.

| When You Started | Tax Year | Registration Deadline |
|------------------|----------|----------------------|
| June 2024 | 2024/25 | 5 October 2025 |
| January 2025 | 2024/25 | 5 October 2025 |
| September 2025 | 2025/26 | 5 October 2026 |

**Why this matters:** HMRC posts your UTR (Unique Taxpayer Reference) within 10 working days. Register late, and you may not have your UTR in time to file by 31 January.

## Paper Return Deadline

### 31 October

If you file a **paper** tax return, the deadline is **31 October**—three months earlier than online.

| Return Type | Deadline |
|-------------|----------|
| Paper | 31 October |
| Online | 31 January |

**Recommendation:** File online. It's faster, you get an extra 3 months, and HMRC calculates your tax automatically.

## Online Return Deadline

### 31 January

The main deadline most people follow. File your online Self Assessment return by **31 January** following the tax year.

| Tax Year | Online Deadline |
|----------|-----------------|
| 2024/25 | 31 January 2026 |
| 2025/26 | 31 January 2027 |

**What counts as filed:** Your return is filed when HMRC receives it, not when you start it. Don't leave it until 11:59pm on 31 January—technical issues could make you late.

## Payment Deadline

### 31 January

Tax owed for the previous year is due by **31 January**—the same date as the filing deadline.

| What's Due | Deadline |
|------------|----------|
| Tax for 2024/25 | 31 January 2026 |
| First payment on account for 2025/26 | 31 January 2026 |

**Important:** If your tax bill exceeds £1,000, you also pay your first **payment on account** for the following year on 31 January.

## Payment on Account Deadlines

If you owe payments on account, there are two deadlines:

| Payment | Deadline | Amount |
|---------|----------|--------|
| First payment on account | 31 January | 50% of previous year's bill |
| Second payment on account | 31 July | 50% of previous year's bill |

### 31 July

The second payment on account is due **31 July**—6 months after the first.

**Example for 2025/26:**
- 31 January 2026: Pay 2024/25 tax + first payment on account
- 31 July 2026: Pay second payment on account

## PAYE Tax Code Deadline

### 30 December

If you want HMRC to collect tax owed (up to £3,000) through your PAYE tax code the following year, file by **30 December**.

| File By | Result |
|---------|--------|
| 30 December 2025 | Tax collected via 2026/27 PAYE code |
| 31 January 2026 | Must pay in full by 31 January |

This only applies if:
- You're employed (have a PAYE income)
- You owe less than £3,000
- You file early enough

## Late Filing Penalties

Missing the 31 January deadline triggers automatic penalties:

| How Late | Penalty |
|----------|---------|
| 1 day late | £100 |
| 3 months late | £10 per day (up to 90 days = £900) |
| 6 months late | £300 or 5% of tax due (whichever is higher) |
| 12 months late | Additional £300 or 5% of tax due |

**Maximum penalty:** £1,600 for being 12+ months late, plus potential additional penalties for serious cases.

### The £100 Penalty

The initial £100 penalty applies **even if you owe no tax**. It's a penalty for late filing, not late payment.

**Example:** You're employed, pay all tax through PAYE, but were briefly self-employed earning £500. You file your return on 2 February (one day late). Penalty: £100—even though you owe nothing.

## Late Payment Penalties

Separate from filing penalties, late **payment** incurs:

| How Late | Penalty |
|----------|---------|
| 30 days late | 5% of tax unpaid |
| 6 months late | Additional 5% of tax unpaid |
| 12 months late | Additional 5% of tax unpaid |

**Plus interest:** HMRC charges interest on late payments from the due date.

### Combined Impact

If you file late AND pay late, you face both penalties:

**Example:** File 3 months late, pay 6 months late on £5,000 tax.
- Filing: £100 + £900 (90 days × £10) = £1,000
- Payment: £250 (5%) + £250 (5%) = £500
- Plus interest
- **Total penalties: ~£1,500+**

## Reasonable Excuse

HMRC may cancel penalties if you have a "reasonable excuse":

| May Be Accepted | Unlikely to Be Accepted |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Serious illness | Being busy |
| Death of close family member | Not knowing the deadline |
| HMRC system failure | Relying on someone else |
| Fire, flood, theft of records | Lack of funds to pay |
| Unexpected hospital stay | Finding it difficult |

If you have a reasonable excuse, contact HMRC as soon as possible.

## How to Avoid Missing Deadlines

### 1. File Early

Don't wait until January. Once the tax year ends (5 April), you can file immediately.

| File In | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| April–June | Maximum time to find errors |
| July–September | Plenty of time if issues arise |
| October–December | Still comfortable |
| January | Risky—problems could make you late |

### 2. Set Calendar Reminders

| Reminder | When |
|----------|------|
| Start preparing return | 1 November |
| Aim to file by | 15 January |
| Final deadline | 31 January |
| Payment deadline | 31 January |
| Second payment on account | 31 July |

### 3. Use Tax Software

Software with deadline reminders helps you stay on track:
- Automatic notifications before deadlines
- Progress tracking throughout the year
- One-click filing when ready

### 4. Gather Records Throughout the Year

Don't scramble in January. Keep records organised:
- Monthly bank reconciliation
- Expense receipts stored digitally
- Income logged as received

## Weekend and Bank Holiday Deadlines

If a deadline falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the deadline is usually the **next working day**.

| Deadline Date | Falls On | Actual Deadline |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| 31 January 2026 | Saturday | Monday 2 February 2026 |
| 31 July 2026 | Friday | Friday 31 July 2026 |

**However:** Don't rely on this. File and pay before the stated date to avoid risk.

## Making Tax Digital Changes

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital) adds **quarterly deadlines**:

| Quarter | Period | Deadline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | 6 Apr – 5 Jul | 7 August |
| Q2 | 6 Jul – 5 Oct | 7 November |
| Q3 | 6 Oct – 5 Jan | 7 February |
| Q4 | 6 Jan – 5 Apr | 7 May |
| Final declaration | Full year | 31 January |

The 31 January deadline remains for the final declaration.
