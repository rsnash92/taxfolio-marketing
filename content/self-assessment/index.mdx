Self Assessment is how you report your income to HMRC and pay the tax you owe. If you're self-employed, a landlord, or have other untaxed income, you'll need to file a Self Assessment tax return each year.

## What is Self Assessment?

Self Assessment is the system HMRC uses to collect Income Tax. Tax is usually deducted automatically from wages and pensions through PAYE (Pay As You Earn), but if you have other income, you need to report it yourself.

Each year, you must:

- **Report your income** from all sources
- **Claim any tax reliefs** you're entitled to
- **Calculate your tax bill** (or let HMRC/software do it)
- **Pay what you owe** by the deadline

## Who Needs to File?

You must send a tax return if any of the following apply:

### Definitely Need to File

- **Self-employed** as a sole trader with income over £1,000
- **Partner** in a business partnership
- **Company director** (unless it's a non-profit)
- **Income over £150,000** from any source
- **Rental income** over £2,500 (or any amount if expenses claimed)
- **Foreign income** that's taxable in the UK
- **Capital gains** above the annual exempt amount
- **Savings or investment income** over £10,000

### Might Need to File

- **Child Benefit claimant** with income over £60,000
- **Employee expenses** to claim over £2,500
- **Pension contributions** over the annual allowance
- **Untaxed income** like tips or commission

If HMRC sends you a notice to file, you must complete a return even if you don't think you need to.

## Key Deadlines for 2024/25

| Deadline | What's Due |
|----------|-----------|
| 5 October 2025 | Register for Self Assessment (if new) |
| 31 October 2025 | Paper tax returns |
| 31 January 2026 | Online tax returns |
| 31 January 2026 | Pay your tax bill |
| 31 July 2026 | Second payment on account (if applicable) |

### Tax Year Dates

The UK tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year. So the 2024/25 tax year covers:

- **Start:** 6 April 2024
- **End:** 5 April 2025

## What You Need to Report

Your Self Assessment covers several types of income and claims:

### Income Sources

- **Self-employment income** (SA103 supplement)
- **Property income** (SA105 supplement)
- **Employment income** if not fully taxed through PAYE
- **Savings and investments** (SA106 supplement)
- **Foreign income** (SA106 supplement)
- **Capital gains** (SA108 supplement)
- **Pension income**

### Expenses and Reliefs

- **Business expenses** for self-employed
- **Property expenses** for landlords
- **Pension contributions**
- **Gift Aid donations**
- **Student loan repayments**

## How to File Your Return

### Option 1: HMRC Online

1. Register for a Government Gateway account
2. Sign up for Self Assessment online
3. Complete the return on HMRC's website
4. Submit and pay by 31 January

### Option 2: Using Software (Recommended)

Software like TaxFolio can:

- **Import your transactions** automatically from your bank
- **Categorise expenses** using AI
- **Calculate your tax** accurately
- **Submit directly** to HMRC
- **Keep your records** organised for 6 years

### Option 3: Paper Return

Paper returns must be received by HMRC by 31 October (3 months earlier than online). HMRC will calculate your tax for you.

## Payment on Account

If your tax bill is over £1,000 and less than 80% was collected through PAYE, you'll need to make payments on account.

These are advance payments towards next year's tax bill:

- **First payment:** 31 January (with your current tax bill)
- **Second payment:** 31 July

Each payment is 50% of your previous year's tax bill. You can reduce them if you expect to earn less.

## Penalties for Late Filing

HMRC takes deadlines seriously:

| How Late | Penalty |
|----------|---------|
| 1 day late | £100 |
| 3 months late | £10/day (up to £900) |
| 6 months late | £300 or 5% of tax due (whichever is higher) |
| 12 months late | Additional £300 or 5% |

You'll also be charged interest on any tax paid late.

## Tips for a Stress-Free Return

### 1. Keep Good Records

Throughout the year, save:
- Invoices and receipts
- Bank statements
- Mileage logs
- Evidence of expenses

### 2. Don't Leave It Late

Starting early gives you time to:
- Find missing information
- Ask questions
- Spread payments if needed

### 3. Use Software

Modern tax software like TaxFolio:
- Reduces errors
- Saves time
- Keeps records secure
- Meets HMRC requirements

### 4. Check Before Submitting

Review your return for:
- Typos in figures
- Missing income sources
- Unclaimed expenses
- Correct tax year

## Common Self Assessment Mistakes

Avoid these frequent errors:

- **Wrong tax year** - Ensure income matches 6 April to 5 April
- **Missing income** - Report all sources, even if tax was paid
- **Overclaiming expenses** - Only claim legitimate business costs
- **Missing deadlines** - Set reminders well in advance
- **Not keeping records** - You must keep them for 6 years
