  - question: "What is payment on account?"
    answer: "Payment on account is an advance payment towards your next tax bill, based on 50% of your previous year's Self Assessment liability. If last year's bill was £4,000, you pay two instalments of £2,000 each—one on 31 January, one on 31 July."
  - question: "When do I pay payment on account?"
    answer: "First payment on account is due 31 January (with your tax return). Second payment on account is due 31 July. Any remaining balance (balancing payment) is due the following 31 January alongside new payments on account."
  - question: "Can I reduce my payment on account?"
    answer: "Yes, if you expect next year's income to be lower. Apply through your Government Gateway account before the payment deadline. If you reduce too much and underpay, HMRC charges interest on the shortfall."
  - question: "Do I have to pay payment on account?"
    answer: "You pay payment on account if your Self Assessment tax bill is over £1,000 AND less than 80% of your total tax was collected at source (e.g., through PAYE). If your bill is under £1,000 or mostly covered by PAYE, you don't pay."

Payment on account is an advance payment towards your **next** tax bill, calculated at **50% of your previous year's Self Assessment liability**. You pay in two instalments: 31 January and 31 July. This helps HMRC collect tax closer to when you earn income, and helps you spread payments rather than facing one large bill.

This guide explains when payments on account apply, how to calculate them, and what to do if your income changes.

## How Payment on Account Works

### The Basic Concept

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| What it is | Advance payment for next year |
| Based on | Previous year's tax bill |
| Amount | 50% of last year's liability |
| Instalments | Two per year |
| Deadlines | 31 January and 31 July |

### Why HMRC Requires It

Self-employed and rental income is taxed after the year ends. Payment on account:

- Collects tax closer to when income is earned
- Spreads your payments across the year
- Reduces year-end payment shock

## When You Pay

### The Payment Cycle

For the 2024/25 tax year (6 April 2024 – 5 April 2025):

| Payment | Deadline | What You Pay |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| 2024/25 tax + 1st POA for 2025/26 | 31 January 2026 | Balance + 50% advance |
| 2nd POA for 2025/26 | 31 July 2026 | 50% advance |
| 2025/26 balance + 1st POA for 2026/27 | 31 January 2027 | Remainder + 50% advance |

**POA = Payment on Account**

### Visualising the Cycle

| Month | What's Due |
|-------|------------|
| January 2026 | Final tax for 2024/25 + 1st payment on account for 2025/26 |
| July 2026 | 2nd payment on account for 2025/26 |
| January 2027 | Balancing payment for 2025/26 + 1st payment on account for 2026/27 |

The cycle continues each year.

## Who Has to Pay

### Payment on Account Applies If

Both conditions must be met:

| Condition | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Self Assessment bill | Over £1,000 |
| Tax not collected at source | More than 20% of total |

### You DON'T Pay If

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Tax bill under £1,000 | Below threshold |
| 80%+ of tax paid via PAYE | Most tax already collected |
| First year of Self Assessment | No previous bill to base on |

### Examples

**Sarah: Freelancer**
- Tax bill: £5,000
- No PAYE income
- **Result:** Pays payment on account (£2,500 × 2)

**James: Employee with Side Hustle**
- PAYE tax: £8,000
- Self Assessment tax: £600
- **Total:** £8,600 (93% via PAYE)
- **Result:** No payment on account (under £1,000 SA liability)

**Emma: Part-Time Employee + Landlord**
- PAYE tax: £3,000
- Self Assessment tax: £1,500
- **Total:** £4,500 (67% via PAYE)
- **Result:** Pays payment on account (over £1,000 and less than 80% via PAYE)

## Calculating Payment on Account

### The Formula

**Each payment on account = 50% of previous year's Self Assessment liability**

| Previous Year's Bill | Each POA | Total POA |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| £2,000 | £1,000 | £2,000 |
| £4,000 | £2,000 | £4,000 |
| £6,000 | £3,000 | £6,000 |
| £10,000 | £5,000 | £10,000 |

### What Counts as 'Previous Year's Liability'

| Included | Not Included |
|----------|-------------|
| Income Tax (Self Assessment) | Tax paid via PAYE |
| Class 4 National Insurance | Student loan repayments |
| Class 2 National Insurance | Penalties or interest |

### Example Calculation

**Tom's 2024/25 Tax Bill:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Income Tax (Self Assessment) | £4,200 |
| Class 4 NI | £1,800 |
| Class 2 NI | £179 |
| **Total SA liability** | **£6,179** |

**Payments on account for 2025/26:**
- 1st POA (31 Jan 2026): £3,089.50
- 2nd POA (31 Jul 2026): £3,089.50

## First Year of Self Assessment

### No Advance Payments

In your first year, there's no previous bill to base payments on account on:

| Year | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| First year | Pay full bill only (no POA) |
| Second year | Pay bill + POA (50% × first year bill) |

### The First Year Shock

Your second January bill includes:

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Remaining 2024/25 tax | Full amount |
| 1st POA for 2025/26 | 50% of 2024/25 bill |
| **Total** | **Up to 150% of first year** |

**Example:**
- First year bill: £6,000
- Second January: £6,000 + £3,000 = **£9,000**

Plan ahead to avoid this shock.

## The Balancing Payment

### When Actual Differs from Estimate

If your 2025/26 income differs from 2024/25:

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Income higher | Balancing payment due |
| Income lower | Refund due |
| Income same | Little or no balance |

### Example: Higher Income

**Previous year:** £40,000 profit, £6,000 tax
**Current year:** £50,000 profit, £8,000 tax

| Payment | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| 1st POA paid | £3,000 |
| 2nd POA paid | £3,000 |
| Actual tax due | £8,000 |
| **Balancing payment** | **£2,000** |

### Example: Lower Income

**Previous year:** £40,000 profit, £6,000 tax
**Current year:** £30,000 profit, £4,000 tax

| Payment | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| 1st POA paid | £3,000 |
| 2nd POA paid | £3,000 |
| Actual tax due | £4,000 |
| **Overpaid** | **£2,000** |

The £2,000 is refunded or offset against next year's payments.

## Reducing Payment on Account

### When to Reduce

You can apply to reduce payments if you expect:

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Lower income | Client loss, reduced work |
| Business ceased | No longer self-employed |
| Higher expenses | One-off large deductions |
| Tax reliefs | Pension contributions, EIS |

### How to Apply

| Method | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| Online | Log in to Government Gateway → Self Assessment → Reduce payments on account |
| Form SA303 | Download, complete, post to HMRC |

### When to Apply

Apply **before** the payment deadline. Ideally:

| Payment | Apply By |
|---------|----------|
| 1st POA (31 Jan) | Early January |
| 2nd POA (31 Jul) | Early July |

### Important Warning

If you reduce payments too much:

| Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Interest charged | On underpaid amount from original due date |
| No penalty | But interest adds up |

Only reduce if you're confident income will be lower.

### Example: Reducing POA

**Situation:**
- Previous year's bill: £8,000
- Each POA due: £4,000
- Expected current year bill: £4,000

**Action:**
- Apply to reduce POA to £2,000 each
- Save £4,000 in advance payments
- Verify estimate is accurate

| Tax | Approximate Rate |
|-----|------------------|
| Income Tax | 20-40% of taxable profit |
| Class 4 NI | 6-2% of profit |
| Class 2 NI | ~£180/year |

### Calendar Reminders

| Reminder | When |
|----------|------|
| Review income | Quarterly |
| Check POA accuracy | November (before Jan deadline) |
| Pay or reduce POA | 2 weeks before deadline |
