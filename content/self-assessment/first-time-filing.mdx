Filing your first Self Assessment tax return can feel overwhelming, but it's simpler than most people expect. This beginner's guide walks you through everything from registration to submission, helping you file your first return confidently and correctly by the **31 January** deadline.

## First-Time Self Assessment Timeline

If this is your first year filing, here's your timeline:

| When | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| **As soon as you start earning** | Begin keeping records of income and expenses |
| **Within first few months** | Register for Self Assessment with HMRC |
| **By 5 October** | Registration deadline (following tax year end) |
| **6 April – 5 April** | The tax year you're reporting on |
| **By 31 January** | File your return and pay tax owed |

**Example:** You started freelancing in June 2024. The tax year is 2024/25 (6 April 2024 – 5 April 2025). Register by 5 October 2025. File and pay by 31 January 2026.

## Step 1: Register for Self Assessment

Before you can file, you need a **Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)**.

### How to Register

1. Go to [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment)
2. Create a Government Gateway account (if you don't have one)
3. Select your registration type (self-employed, landlord, etc.)
4. Provide your personal and business details
5. Submit the registration

### What Happens Next

- HMRC posts your UTR within **10 working days**
- Your UTR is a 10-digit number (e.g., 1234567890)
- Keep it safe—you'll use it for all tax matters

## Step 2: Understand What You're Reporting

Self Assessment reports your income and expenses for the **tax year** (6 April to 5 April).

### Income to Report

| Income Type | What to Include |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Self-employment** | All money received for work (invoiced and cash) |
| **Rental income** | Rent from tenants, Airbnb, etc. |
| **Employment** | Already taxed via PAYE—but still report if filing |
| **Savings interest** | Above Personal Savings Allowance |
| **Dividends** | Above Dividend Allowance (£500) |
| **Other income** | Anything not taxed at source |

### Expenses to Deduct

Expenses reduce your taxable profit. Only claim costs that are "wholly and exclusively" for business:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Office costs | Software, stationery, phone (business %) |
| Travel | Mileage (45p/mile), public transport, parking |
| Professional fees | Accountant, legal advice, subscriptions |
| Marketing | Website, advertising, business cards |
| Equipment | Computer, tools (or capital allowances) |
| Home office | Simplified expenses (£10-26/month) |

## Step 3: Keep Records Throughout the Year

Good records make filing easy. Poor records make it stressful.

### What Records to Keep

| Record Type | Keep For |
|-------------|----------|
| Sales invoices | All income |
| Bank statements | Proof of transactions |
| Expense receipts | Every business purchase |
| Mileage log | Business travel |
| Contracts | Client agreements |

### How Long to Keep Records

Keep all records for **6 years** after the tax year. HMRC can enquire within this period.

### Record-Keeping Tips for Beginners

1. **Separate bank account** — Don't mix business and personal
2. **Photograph receipts** — Paper fades; digital doesn't
3. **Categorise as you go** — Don't leave it until January
4. **Use software** — Makes tracking automatic

## Step 4: Calculate Your Profit

Your tax is based on **profit**, not income:

**Profit = Total Income − Allowable Expenses**

### Example Calculation

**First-Year Freelancer:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total income received | £28,000 |
| Office costs | £600 |
| Software subscriptions | £480 |
| Travel (mileage) | £1,200 |
| Home office (simplified) | £216 |
| Professional fees | £300 |
| **Total expenses** | **£2,796** |
| **Taxable profit** | **£25,204** |

## Step 5: Understand Your Tax Bill

### Income Tax

| Band | Taxable Amount | Rate |
|------|----------------|------|
| Personal Allowance | £0 – £12,570 | 0% |
| Basic Rate | £12,571 – £50,270 | 20% |
| Higher Rate | £50,271 – £125,140 | 40% |
| Additional Rate | Over £125,140 | 45% |

### National Insurance (Self-Employed)

| Type | Rate | When |
|------|------|------|
| Class 2 | £3.45/week (£179.40/year) | Profits over £6,725 |
| Class 4 | 6% | Profits £12,570 – £50,270 |
| Class 4 | 2% | Profits over £50,270 |

### First-Year Tax Calculation Example

Using the £25,204 profit from above:

**Income Tax:**
| Band | Amount | Tax |
|------|--------|-----|
| Personal Allowance | £12,570 | £0 |
| Basic Rate (£25,204 − £12,570) | £12,634 | £2,526.80 |
| **Total Income Tax** | | **£2,526.80** |

**National Insurance:**
| Type | Calculation | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Class 2 | £179.40 | £179.40 |
| Class 4 | 6% × (£25,204 − £12,570) | £758.04 |
| **Total NI** | | **£937.44** |

**Total First-Year Tax: £3,464.24**
**Effective Tax Rate: 13.7%**

## Step 6: File Your Return

### Option A: HMRC Online (Free)

1. Sign in at [gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns)
2. Complete the SA100 form section by section
3. Add supplementary pages (SA103 for self-employment, SA105 for property)
4. Review your tax calculation
5. Submit

**Pros:** Free
**Cons:** Manual data entry, no bank connection, basic interface

### Option B: Tax Software (Recommended)

1. Connect your bank account
2. Software imports and categorises transactions
3. Review and adjust figures
4. Software calculates your tax
5. Submit directly to HMRC

**Pros:** Faster, fewer errors, bank integration, real-time calculations
**Cons:** Annual cost (typically £70-150/year)

TaxFolio is MTD-compatible software from £69.99/year.

## Step 7: Pay Your Tax

### Payment Deadline

Pay by **31 January** following the tax year.

For 2024/25 tax year: Pay by 31 January 2026.

### How to Pay

| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Online banking | Use your UTR + "K" as reference |
| Debit card | Via HMRC website |
| Direct Debit | Set up for future payments |
| Bank transfer | BACS or Faster Payments |

### Payment on Account (Maybe)

If your tax bill exceeds £1,000, you may need to make **payments on account**—advance payments towards next year's bill:

- **31 January:** 50% of this year's bill (as advance for next year)
- **31 July:** Another 50%

This can be a surprise for first-timers. Budget accordingly.

## Common First-Time Mistakes

### 1. Missing the Deadline

The 31 January deadline is firm. Miss it and you face:
- £100 automatic penalty
- £10/day after 3 months (up to £900)
- Further penalties at 6 and 12 months

**Solution:** File early—even in April if you have the records.

### 2. Forgetting to Register

You need a UTR before you can file. If you register late, you can't file on time.

**Solution:** Register as soon as you start earning taxable income.

### 3. Not Claiming Legitimate Expenses

Many first-timers under-claim expenses, paying more tax than necessary.

**Solution:** Review common expense categories. If it's genuinely for business, claim it.

### 4. Wrong Tax Year

The tax year runs 6 April to 5 April, not January to December.

**Solution:** Income received on 1 March 2025 is in 2024/25. Income received on 10 April 2025 is in 2025/26.

### 5. Mixing Business and Personal

Using one bank account for everything makes record-keeping difficult.

**Solution:** Open a dedicated business bank account—even a free one.

### 6. Not Keeping Receipts

Without receipts, you can't prove expenses if HMRC enquires.

**Solution:** Photograph receipts immediately. Store digitally.

### 7. Forgetting About Payments on Account

Your first filing may also require payment on account for next year.

**Solution:** Budget for 150% of your expected tax bill for the first payment.

## First-Time Checklist

### Before You Start

- [ ] Registered for Self Assessment
- [ ] Received UTR from HMRC
- [ ] Set up Government Gateway online access
- [ ] Gathered all income records
- [ ] Organised expense receipts
- [ ] Got P60/P45 (if also employed)

### During Filing

- [ ] Reporting correct tax year (6 April – 5 April)
- [ ] Included all income sources
- [ ] Claimed all legitimate expenses
- [ ] Checked calculations match your records
- [ ] Reviewed tax calculation before submitting

### After Filing

- [ ] Saved submission confirmation
- [ ] Noted payment amount and deadline
- [ ] Set up payment method
- [ ] Saved records for 6 years
- [ ] Marked next year's deadlines in calendar

## Special Situations for First-Timers

### Part-Year Self-Employment

If you started partway through the year:

- Report only income from when you started
- Claim expenses from when you started
- Still get full Personal Allowance (not pro-rated)

**Example:** Started freelancing 1 September 2024. Report income and expenses from September 2024 – 5 April 2025 only.

### Self-Employed AND Employed

If you have a day job plus freelance work:

- Employment income (PAYE) goes in the employment section
- Self-employment income goes in SA103
- Both combine for your total taxable income
- You may be pushed into a higher tax bracket

### Small Amount of Income

If your self-employment income is under £1,000:
- The **Trading Allowance** means you don't need to file for self-employment
- But you may still need to file for other reasons

### Made a Loss

If expenses exceed income (a loss):
- Report the loss
- It can offset other income this year, or
- Carry forward to reduce future profits

Losses are valuable—don't forget to claim them.

## What to Expect: Your First Filing Experience

### Time Required

| Situation | Approximate Time |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Simple self-employment, organised records | 1-2 hours |
| Simple self-employment, messy records | 3-5 hours |
| Multiple income sources | 2-4 hours |
| Using software with bank connection | 30-60 minutes |

### Emotional Experience

Filing your first return often feels:
- **Stressful at first** — it's unfamiliar
- **Better once you start** — it's more straightforward than expected
- **Satisfying when done** — you've met a legal obligation
- **Educational** — you now understand your tax position

### Cost of Your First Year

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Registration | Free |
| HMRC online filing | Free |
| Tax software (optional but recommended) | £70-150/year |
| Accountant (if you choose) | £150-500+ |

Many first-timers successfully file without an accountant.

## After Your First Filing

### Good Habits to Start

1. **Track income weekly** — not at year-end
2. **Categorise expenses monthly** — stay current
3. **Set aside 25-30%** — for tax throughout the year
4. **Keep records organised** — digital is easiest
5. **Mark deadlines** — calendar reminders help

### Future Filings

Your second year is easier because:
- You already have a UTR
- You understand the process
- You have systems in place
- Software remembers your categories

### Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), Self Assessment changes to quarterly reporting under [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital).

Choosing MTD-compatible software now means you'll be ready.
