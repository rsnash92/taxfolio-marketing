faqs:
  - question: "What can I claim as a tax deduction in the UK?"
    answer: "You can claim any expense that is 'wholly and exclusively' for business purposes. This includes office costs, travel, equipment, professional fees, marketing, and a proportion of home costs if you work from home."
  - question: "Can I claim food and drink as a business expense?"
    answer: "Generally no - food for yourself is not deductible as it's considered a personal expense you'd have anyway. The exception is subsistence when travelling overnight for business, where you can claim reasonable meal costs."
  - question: "How do I claim expenses without receipts?"
    answer: "HMRC expects you to keep receipts for all claims. If you've lost a receipt, bank statements can provide supporting evidence for small items, but it's risky. Use apps like TaxFolio to photograph receipts instantly."
  - question: "What's the difference between expenses and capital allowances?"
    answer: "Expenses are day-to-day running costs deducted in full when incurred. Capital allowances are for expensive equipment that lasts several years - you can claim 100% upfront via the Annual Investment Allowance or spread the deduction over time."

Understanding what you can claim as a business expense is one of the most effective ways to reduce your tax bill. This guide covers everything UK sole traders, freelancers, and landlords need to know.

## The Golden Rule of Expenses

To be deductible, an expense must be **"wholly and exclusively"** for business purposes.

This doesn't mean you can't claim items with some personal use - it means you can only claim the business proportion.

**Example:** If your mobile phone is 70% business, 30% personal, you can claim 70% of the cost.

## Categories of Allowable Expenses

### Office and Premises Costs

**Fully Deductible:**
- Business rent and rates
- Utilities for business premises
- Office cleaning
- Security costs

**Working From Home:**

You can claim a proportion of household costs if you work from home.

**Option 1: Simplified Expenses (Easy)**

| Hours worked from home per month | Monthly flat rate |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| 25-50 hours | £10 |
| 51-100 hours | £18 |
| 101+ hours | £26 |

**Option 2: Actual Costs (Better for Dedicated Space)**

Calculate the business proportion of:
- Mortgage interest or rent
- Council tax
- Electricity and gas
- Water rates
- Home insurance
- Repairs and maintenance

Methods to calculate proportion:
- Number of rooms: 1 room out of 6 = 16.7%
- Square footage: 10m² of 100m² = 10%
- Time-based: 8 hours of 24 = 33%

### Travel and Transport

**Business Mileage (Personal Vehicle)**

| Miles | Rate per mile |
|-------|---------------|
| First 10,000 | 45p |
| Over 10,000 | 25p |

### Tips for Good Records
