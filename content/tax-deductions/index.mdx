faqs:
  - question: "What can I claim as a tax deduction in the UK?"
    answer: "You can claim expenses that are wholly and exclusively for business purposes: office costs, travel, equipment, professional fees, marketing, insurance, and a proportion of home costs if you work from home."
  - question: "Can I claim food and drink as a business expense?"
    answer: "Generally no—food for yourself is a personal expense you would incur anyway. The exception is subsistence when travelling overnight for business, where you can claim reasonable meal costs."
  - question: "How do I claim expenses without receipts?"
    answer: "HMRC expects receipts for all expense claims. For small items without receipts, bank statements can provide supporting evidence, but this is risky. Use accounting software to photograph and store receipts immediately."
  - question: "What is the difference between expenses and capital allowances?"
    answer: "Expenses are day-to-day running costs deducted in full when incurred. Capital allowances are for equipment lasting several years—you can claim 100% via the Annual Investment Allowance (up to £1 million) or spread the deduction over time."

UK self-employed individuals and landlords can deduct allowable expenses from their income before calculating tax. To be deductible, an expense must be "wholly and exclusively" for business purposes. Claiming all legitimate expenses is one of the most effective ways to reduce your tax bill.

This guide covers what you can claim, HMRC mileage rates, home office deductions, capital allowances, and common expenses people miss.

## The Golden Rule: Wholly and Exclusively

HMRC allows you to deduct expenses that are **wholly and exclusively** for business purposes. This doesn't mean you can't claim items with some personal use—it means you can only claim the business proportion.

**Example:** Your mobile phone is 70% business, 30% personal. You can claim 70% of the cost.

Mixed-use items require honest apportionment. Keep records showing how you calculated the business proportion.

## Categories of Allowable Expenses

### Office and Premises Costs

**Fully Deductible:**
- Business rent and rates
- Utilities for business premises
- Office cleaning
- Security costs
- Business insurance

**Business proportion deductible:**
- Phone and broadband (business calls/usage)
- Equipment used for business

### Working From Home

If you work from home, you can claim either simplified expenses or actual costs.

**Option 1: Simplified Expenses (Flat Rate)**

| Hours worked from home per month | Monthly flat rate |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| 25–50 hours | £10 |
| 51–100 hours | £18 |
| 101+ hours | £26 |

Simplified expenses are easy to calculate but may undervalue your claim if you have a dedicated home office.

**Option 2: Actual Costs (Proportional)**

Calculate the business proportion of:
- Mortgage interest or rent
- Council tax
- Electricity and gas
- Water rates
- Home insurance
- Repairs and maintenance (to the whole property)

Methods to calculate the proportion:
- **Room count:** 1 room out of 6 = 16.7%
- **Square footage:** 10m² of 100m² = 10%
- **Time-based:** 8 hours of 24 = 33%

Actual costs often give a higher deduction if you have a dedicated office space.

### Travel and Transport

**Mileage Allowance (Personal Vehicle)**

If you use your personal vehicle for business, claim mileage at HMRC's approved rates:

| Miles per tax year | Rate per mile |
|--------------------|---------------|
| First 10,000 | 45p |
| Over 10,000 | 25p |

This covers fuel, insurance, servicing, and depreciation—you cannot claim these separately if using mileage rates.

## Capital Allowances

Capital allowances let you deduct the cost of business assets that last several years.

| 1-50g/km | 18% writing down allowance |
| Over 50g/km | 6% writing down allowance |

Only the business-use proportion is allowable.

## Common Expenses People Miss

Many self-employed people under-claim. Review your records for:

1. **Bank fees** — Monthly charges, transaction fees, foreign exchange fees
2. **Software subscriptions** — Often forgotten small monthly amounts
3. **Phone bills** — Business proportion of personal phone
4. **Home office** — Heating, lighting, broadband, council tax (proportion)
5. **Mileage** — Short trips to the post office, bank, suppliers, clients
6. **Professional subscriptions** — Industry bodies, journals, magazines
7. **Training** — Webinars, online courses, books
8. **Insurance** — Professional indemnity, public liability
9. **Parking** — When visiting clients or suppliers
10. **Stationery** — Printer ink, paper, envelopes, postage

## Record-Keeping Requirements

HMRC requires you to keep evidence for all expense claims:

- **Receipts** for all purchases
- **Invoices** you've issued and received
- **Bank statements** showing transactions
- **Mileage logs** for vehicle claims

Records must be kept for **6 years** after the relevant tax year.

### Tips for Good Record-Keeping

1. **Photograph receipts immediately** — paper fades and gets lost
2. **Use accounting software** — automatic categorisation and storage
3. **Separate bank accounts** — don't mix personal and business
4. **Review monthly** — don't leave it until year-end
5. **Back up digitally** — cloud storage for safety
