Making Tax Digital (MTD) is a UK government initiative requiring self-employed individuals and landlords to maintain digital records and submit quarterly updates to HMRC using compatible software. MTD becomes mandatory on 6 April 2026 for those with gross income over £50,000.

This guide covers who MTD affects, the key deadlines, software requirements, and how to prepare before the April 2026 deadline.

## Who Must Comply with MTD

MTD for Income Tax Self Assessment (MTD ITSA) applies to:

- **Self-employed sole traders** with gross income over the threshold
- **Landlords** with gross property income over the threshold
- **Partners in partnerships** (from April 2025 for general partnerships)

Your gross income determines when you must comply—not your profit.

### MTD Income Thresholds

| Compliance Date | Income Threshold | Estimated Taxpayers Affected |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| 6 April 2026 | Over £50,000 | 780,000 |
| 6 April 2027 | Over £30,000 | 970,000 |
| TBC | Over £20,000 | To be announced |

According to [HMRC guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax), these thresholds apply to gross income from self-employment and/or property combined.

## What MTD Requires

Under MTD, you must:

1. **Maintain digital records** using MTD-compatible software
2. **Submit quarterly updates** summarising income and expenses
3. **File a final declaration** confirming your annual figures
4. **Keep records for 6 years** as required by HMRC

### Digital Record-Keeping Requirements

Your MTD software must digitally store:

- All business income received
- All allowable business expenses
- The date, amount, and category of each transaction

Paper records and spreadsheets alone will not meet MTD requirements. You need software that connects to HMRC's MTD API.

## MTD Quarterly Update Deadlines

Each tax year, you submit four quarterly updates plus a final declaration:

| Quarter | Period Covered | Submission Deadline |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Q1 | 6 April – 5 July | 7 August |
| Q2 | 6 July – 5 October | 7 November |
| Q3 | 6 October – 5 January | 7 February |
| Q4 | 6 January – 5 April | 7 May |
| Final Declaration | Full tax year | 31 January |

For the 2026/27 tax year (the first MTD year for those over £50,000), your first quarterly update is due 7 August 2026.

## MTD Software Requirements

HMRC requires software that can:

- Store digital records of income and expenses
- Calculate tax liability
- Submit quarterly updates via the MTD API
- File the end-of-period statement and final declaration

### MTD-Compatible Software

HMRC maintains an [official list of MTD-compatible software](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax) on GOV.UK.

TaxFolio is MTD-compatible software that handles MTD compliance for self-employed individuals and landlords. Key features include:

- **Open Banking connections** to UK banks via TrueLayer (FCA-authorised)
- **AI-powered transaction categorisation** for expenses
- **Automatic quarterly reminders** before each deadline
- **One-click HMRC submission** via the MTD API
- **SA103 and SA105 support** for self-employment and property income

### Can I Use Spreadsheets?

Spreadsheets alone do not meet MTD requirements. However, you can use spreadsheets with "bridging software" that submits your data to HMRC in the correct format. This adds complexity—most users find full MTD software simpler.

## MTD Penalties

HMRC operates a points-based penalty system for late submissions:

### Late Submission Penalties

| Points Accumulated | Consequence |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 point | Warning (no fine) |
| 2 points | Warning (no fine) |
| 3 points | Warning (no fine) |
| 4 points | £200 penalty |
| 5+ points | £200 per additional late submission |

Points expire after 24 months of on-time submissions.

### Late Payment Penalties

Separate from submission penalties:

- **15 days late**: First penalty charge begins accruing
- **30 days late**: Additional charge
- **Interest**: Accrues from the payment due date

## How to Prepare for MTD

### Step 1: Determine Your Compliance Date

Calculate your gross income from self-employment and property:

- **Over £50,000**: You must comply from 6 April 2026
- **£30,000–£50,000**: You must comply from 6 April 2027
- **Under £30,000**: Not yet required (threshold TBC)

### Step 2: Choose MTD Software

Select MTD-compatible software before your compliance date. Consider:

- Does it connect to your bank?
- Does it handle your income types (self-employment, property, or both)?
- What is the annual cost?
- Is there a free trial?

### Step 3: Connect Your Bank Accounts

Link your business bank accounts to your MTD software. This automates transaction imports and reduces manual data entry.

TaxFolio connects to all major UK banks via Open Banking (TrueLayer), providing read-only access to transactions.

### Step 4: Categorise Historical Transactions

Before your first quarterly update, categorise past transactions to establish accurate records. AI categorisation in TaxFolio automates most of this work.

### Step 5: Submit a Practice Quarter

Run through the quarterly update process before it counts. This identifies any gaps in your record-keeping.

## MTD for Different Income Types

### MTD for Self-Employed (SA103)

Self-employed sole traders report business income and expenses. Your MTD software must track:

- All business income
- Allowable business expenses by category
- Capital allowances on equipment

Learn more in our [Sole Trader Tax Guide](/sole-trader-tax).

### MTD for Landlords (SA105)

Landlords with property income report rental income and property expenses. Your MTD software must track:

- Rental income from each property
- Allowable property expenses
- Mortgage interest (for tax credit calculation)

Learn more in our [Landlord Tax Guide](/landlord-tax).

### Multiple Income Sources

If you have both self-employment and property income, your gross income from both sources combined determines your threshold. You submit updates covering all income types.

TaxFolio handles both SA103 (self-employment) and SA105 (property) in a single account.

## MTD vs Traditional Self Assessment

| Aspect | Traditional Self Assessment | Making Tax Digital |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Record-keeping | Paper or digital | Digital only |
| Submissions | Once per year | Quarterly + final |
| Deadline | 31 January | Quarterly + 31 January |
| Software | Optional | Required |
| Real-time tax view | No | Yes |

MTD provides more frequent visibility into your tax position, reducing January surprises.

## Exemptions from MTD

Some taxpayers are exempt from MTD:

- Those with gross income below the threshold
- Individuals who are digitally excluded (cannot use computers)
- Those with religious objections to digital technology

If you believe you qualify for an exemption, contact HMRC.
