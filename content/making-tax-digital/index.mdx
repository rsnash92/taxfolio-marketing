Making Tax Digital (MTD) represents the biggest change to UK tax administration in a generation. If you're self-employed or a landlord, you need to understand what's coming and how to prepare.

## What is Making Tax Digital?

Making Tax Digital is HMRC's initiative to modernise the UK tax system. Instead of keeping paper records and filing once a year, you'll need to:

- **Keep digital records** of your income and expenses
- **Submit quarterly updates** to HMRC
- **Use compatible software** to manage your taxes

The goal is to reduce errors, make tax administration more efficient, and give you a clearer picture of your tax position throughout the year.

## Who Does MTD Affect?

MTD for Income Tax applies to:

- **Self-employed individuals** (sole traders)
- **Landlords** with property income
- **Partners** in partnerships

You're affected if your gross income from self-employment and/or property exceeds the threshold.

## MTD Timeline and Thresholds

| Date | Who Must Comply |
|------|-----------------|
| April 2026 | Income over £50,000 |
| April 2027 | Income over £30,000 |
| To be announced | Income over £20,000 |

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Choose Compatible Software

You'll need HMRC-recognised software like TaxFolio that can:
- Keep digital records
- Calculate your tax position
- Submit quarterly updates to HMRC
- File your final declaration

### 2. Keep Digital Records

Your records must include:
- All business income
- All allowable expenses
- Supporting documentation

### 3. Submit Quarterly Updates

Every quarter, you'll send HMRC a summary of your income and expenses. The deadlines are:

- **Q1** (6 April - 5 July): Submit by 7 August
- **Q2** (6 July - 5 October): Submit by 7 November
- **Q3** (6 October - 5 January): Submit by 7 February
- **Q4** (6 January - 5 April): Submit by 7 May

### 4. File Your Final Declaration

After the tax year ends, you'll submit a final declaration confirming your figures and claiming any reliefs or allowances.

## How TaxFolio Makes MTD Easy

TaxFolio is designed from the ground up for Making Tax Digital:

- **Automatic bank sync** pulls in your transactions
- **AI categorisation** sorts expenses into the right tax categories
- **Quarterly reminders** ensure you never miss a deadline
- **One-click submission** sends updates directly to HMRC

## Common MTD Questions

### Can I still use spreadsheets?

Spreadsheets alone won't be enough. You'll need compatible software that can communicate with HMRC. However, you can use spreadsheets alongside bridging software.

### What if I miss a quarterly deadline?

Late submissions may result in penalties. HMRC operates a points-based system where accumulated points lead to financial penalties.

### Do I still need an accountant?

For straightforward tax affairs, MTD software like TaxFolio can handle everything. Complex situations may still benefit from professional advice.
