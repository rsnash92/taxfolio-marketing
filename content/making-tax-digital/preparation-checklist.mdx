faqs:
  - question: "How do I prepare for Making Tax Digital?"
    answer: "Choose HMRC-recognised MTD software, connect your business bank account, set up expense categories, import historical data if needed, and practice the workflow before MTD becomes mandatory. Start 3-6 months early."
  - question: "What do I need for MTD compliance?"
    answer: "You need HMRC-recognised software that stores digital records and submits quarterly updates via the MTD API. You also need to maintain digital records of all income and expenses with digital links (no manual re-keying)."
  - question: "When should I start preparing for MTD?"
    answer: "Start at least 6 months before your mandatory start date. If MTD applies from April 2026, begin preparation in October 2025. This gives time to choose software, learn the system, and resolve issues."
  - question: "Can I test MTD before it's mandatory?"
    answer: "Yes. You can join MTD voluntarily before your mandatory date. This lets you practice quarterly submissions without penalty for errors. Many software providers also offer test/sandbox modes."

Making Tax Digital requires digital record keeping and quarterly submissions using HMRC-recognised software. To be ready for **April 2026** (income over £50,000) or **April 2027** (income over £30,000), start preparing at least 6 months in advance. This checklist guides you through everything you need to do.

|------|----------|
| Check if MTD applies to you | Essential |
| Research MTD software options | Essential |
| Choose and sign up for software | Essential |

## Step 1: Check If MTD Applies to You

### Income Thresholds

| Your Gross Income | MTD Start Date |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Over £50,000 | 6 April 2026 |
| Over £30,000 | 6 April 2027 |
| Under £30,000 | Not yet required |

### What Counts as Gross Income?

| Income Type | Counts? |
|-------------|---------|
| Self-employment turnover | Yes |
| Rental income | Yes |
| Employment income (PAYE) | No |
| Dividends | No |
| Pension income | No |

**Combined:** If you have both self-employment and rental income, add them together.

**Example:**
- Self-employment: £35,000
- Rental: £20,000
- **Combined: £55,000** → MTD from April 2026

## Step 2: Choose MTD Software

### Requirements

Your software must:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Be on HMRC's recognised list | Mandatory for compliance |
| Store digital records | Core MTD requirement |

## Step 3: Connect Your Bank

### Why Bank Connection Matters

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Automatic transaction import | No manual entry |
| Digital links compliance | Meets HMRC requirements |
| Accuracy | Reduces errors |
| Time saving | Categorise, don't type |

### How to Connect

Most MTD software uses **Open Banking**:

1. Select your bank from the list
2. Log in to your bank's secure site
3. Authorise the connection
4. Transactions import (usually within 24 hours)

### Multiple Accounts

If you have separate accounts for different purposes:

| Account | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Business current account | Connect (essential) |
| Business savings | Connect (if used for business) |
| Rental income account | Connect (if separate) |
| Personal account | Don't connect (unless mixed use) |

**Recommendation:** Use a dedicated business account. It simplifies everything.

## Step 4: Set Up Categories

### Standard HMRC Categories

MTD submissions use standard expense categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Cost of goods sold | Materials, stock, subcontractors |
| Car, van, travel | Mileage, fuel, public transport |
| Wages and salaries | Staff costs |
| Rent, rates, power | Business premises |
| Repairs | Equipment and property maintenance |
| Phone | Telecommunications |
| Accountancy | Professional fees |
| Interest | Business loan interest |
| Other expenses | Everything else allowable |

### Category Setup Checklist

- [ ] Review default categories in your software
- [ ] Add any custom categories needed
- [ ] Set up rules for recurring transactions (e.g., always categorise direct debits to X)
- [ ] Create categories for both income and expenses

## Step 5: Import Historical Data

### Why Import History?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Continuity | See full picture, not just from MTD start |
| Comparisons | Compare quarters year-on-year |
| Catch-up | Categorise past transactions to learn the system |

### How Much to Import

| Option | When Useful |
|--------|-------------|
| Current tax year | Minimum recommended |
| Previous full tax year | Better for comparison |
| 2+ years | If switching from another system |

### Import Methods

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Bank feed (automatic) | May import up to 2 years of history |
| CSV import | Export from old system, import to new |
| Manual entry | Last resort for missing data |

## Step 6: Categorise Transactions

### Initial Categorisation

Once transactions are imported:

1. Review uncategorised transactions
2. Assign correct category to each
3. Split transactions if needed (e.g., mixed personal/business)
4. Mark personal transactions as such (exclude from business)

### Build Categorisation Rules

Most software learns from your choices:

| Transaction | Rule Created |
|-------------|--------------|
| "ADOBE SYSTEMS" → Software | Auto-categorise future Adobe charges |
| "SCREWFIX" → Materials | Auto-categorise future Screwfix purchases |
| "SHELL" → Travel | Auto-categorise fuel purchases |

### Review AI Suggestions

If using software with AI categorisation (like TaxFolio):

1. Review suggested categories
2. Accept correct suggestions
3. Correct wrong suggestions (improves future accuracy)
4. Train the system with your patterns

## Step 7: Learn the Quarterly Workflow

### What a Quarterly Submission Includes

| Data | Source |
|------|--------|
| Total income for quarter | Categorised income transactions |
| Total expenses by category | Categorised expense transactions |
| Running year-to-date totals | Accumulated from previous quarters |

### Practice Run

Before MTD is mandatory:

1. Run a quarterly summary report
2. Review the figures
3. Check they match your expectations
4. Identify any missing or miscategorised items
5. Understand what HMRC will see

### Quarterly Deadlines

| Quarter | Period | Deadline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | 6 Apr – 5 Jul | 7 August |
| Q2 | 6 Jul – 5 Oct | 7 November |
| Q3 | 6 Oct – 5 Jan | 7 February |
| Q4 | 6 Jan – 5 Apr | 7 May |

## Step 8: Clean Up Records

### Before MTD Starts

- [ ] All transactions categorised
- [ ] Personal transactions excluded
- [ ] Duplicates removed
- [ ] Missing income added
- [ ] Receipts attached to expenses (recommended)

### Data Quality Check

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Income matches bank deposits | Reconcile any differences |
| Expenses have receipts | Attach digital copies |
| Categories are consistent | Review and standardise |
| No gaps in transaction history | Import missing data |

## Step 9: Consider Voluntary MTD

### Benefits of Early Adoption

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Learn without pressure | Mistakes aren't penalised |
| Build good habits | Routine established before mandatory |
| Identify issues early | Time to resolve problems |
| Confidence | Know the system works |

### How to Join Voluntarily

1. Ensure your software supports voluntary MTD
2. Sign up for MTD for Income Tax with HMRC
3. Submit quarterly updates as if mandatory
4. File final declaration

**Note:** Even voluntary submissions become your official record once submitted.

## Step 10: Establish Ongoing Routine

### Weekly Tasks

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Review new transactions | 10-15 minutes |
| Categorise uncategorised items | 5-10 minutes |
| Capture any missing receipts | As needed |

### Monthly Tasks

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Reconcile bank statements | 15-20 minutes |
| Review expense categories | 10 minutes |
| Check for missing income | 5 minutes |

### Quarterly Tasks

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Final review of quarter's data | 20-30 minutes |
| Submit quarterly update | 5-10 minutes |
| Review tax estimate | 5 minutes |

## Common Preparation Mistakes

### 1. Leaving It Too Late

Starting in March for an April deadline is too late. Issues arise—software problems, data import failures, learning curves. Start 6 months early.

### 2. Not Connecting the Bank

Manual entry defeats MTD's purpose and creates compliance risk (digital links requirement). Use Open Banking.

### 3. Ignoring Historical Data

Starting fresh on day one of MTD is harder than importing history. You lose context and comparison ability.

### 4. Wrong Software Choice

Choosing software that doesn't meet your needs wastes time. Research properly, try free trials, then commit.

### 5. No Routine Established

MTD requires ongoing maintenance, not just quarterly rushes. Build weekly habits before it's mandatory.
