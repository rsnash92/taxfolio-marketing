faqs:
  - question: "When does MTD start for self-employed?"
    answer: "MTD for self-employed begins 6 April 2026 if your gross self-employment income exceeds £50,000, and 6 April 2027 if it exceeds £30,000. The threshold is based on gross income (turnover), not profit."
  - question: "What do self-employed people need to do for MTD?"
    answer: "You must keep digital records using HMRC-recognised software, submit quarterly updates summarising income and expenses, and file a final declaration by 31 January. You'll need software that connects to HMRC's MTD API."
  - question: "Do I need MTD software if I'm self-employed?"
    answer: "Yes. MTD requires HMRC-recognised software that can store digital records and submit quarterly updates via the MTD API. Spreadsheets alone don't qualify—you need either full accounting software or bridging software."
  - question: "Can self-employed people use spreadsheets for MTD?"
    answer: "You can use spreadsheets to track transactions, but you'll need bridging software to submit data to HMRC. Full MTD software like TaxFolio is simpler as it handles record-keeping and submission in one system."

Making Tax Digital (MTD) for self-employed individuals requires sole traders to keep digital records and submit quarterly updates to HMRC using compatible software. MTD for Income Tax Self Assessment (MTD ITSA) begins **6 April 2026** for those with gross income over £50,000, and **6 April 2027** for those earning over £30,000.

This guide covers everything self-employed sole traders need to know about MTD compliance.

## When Does MTD Apply to You?

MTD applies based on your **gross self-employment income** (turnover), not your profit:

| Your Gross Income | MTD Start Date | First Quarterly Submission |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Over £50,000 | 6 April 2026 | 7 August 2026 |
| Over £30,000 | 6 April 2027 | 7 August 2027 |
| Under £30,000 | TBC (likely 2028+) | Not yet required |

### What Counts as Gross Income?

Gross income means your total business receipts before deducting any expenses:

| Included in Gross Income | NOT Included |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| All sales and fees received | Business expenses |
| Client payments | Cost of goods sold |
| Grants and subsidies | Equipment purchases |
| Interest on business accounts | Your salary/drawings |

**Example:** You invoice £60,000 in the tax year but spend £15,000 on expenses. Your gross income is £60,000, so you must comply from April 2026—even though your profit is only £45,000.

### Combined Income Sources

If you have multiple income sources, they're combined to determine whether you meet the threshold:

- Self-employment income + property income = combined threshold
- Multiple self-employments are added together

**Example:** You earn £35,000 from freelancing and £20,000 from rental property. Combined gross income: £55,000. You must comply from April 2026.

## What MTD Requires from Self-Employed

### 1. Digital Record Keeping

You must maintain digital records of all business transactions:

| Record Type | What to Track |
|-------------|---------------|
| Income | Date, amount, source of each payment received |
| Expenses | Date, amount, category of each business expense |
| Bank transactions | All business account activity |

"Digital" means using software—not paper records or manual spreadsheets without MTD-compatible submission capability.

### 2. HMRC-Recognised Software

Your software must be on [HMRC's list of recognised MTD software](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax). The software must:

- Store records digitally
- Calculate your tax position
- Submit quarterly updates to HMRC via the MTD API
- File your final declaration

TaxFolio is HMRC-recognised MTD software built for UK self-employed individuals.

### 3. Quarterly Submissions

Submit summaries of your income and expenses four times per year:

| Quarter | Period | Deadline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | 6 April – 5 July | 7 August |
| Q2 | 6 July – 5 October | 7 November |
| Q3 | 6 October – 5 January | 7 February |
| Q4 | 6 January – 5 April | 7 May |

Each submission includes:
- Total income received during the quarter
- Total expenses by category
- Running totals for the tax year

Learn more: [MTD Quarterly Submissions Guide](/making-tax-digital/quarterly-submissions)

### 4. Final Declaration

After the tax year ends, submit a final declaration by **31 January** confirming:

- Total income for the year
- All allowable expenses
- Adjustments and reliefs
- Your final tax liability

This replaces the traditional Self Assessment return.

## What Changes for Self-Employed Under MTD

| Aspect | Before MTD | Under MTD |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Record format | Paper or digital | Digital only |
| Reporting frequency | Once per year | 4 quarterly + final declaration |
| Submission method | Online or paper | MTD software via API |
| Software | Optional | Required (HMRC-recognised) |
| Deadlines | 31 January only | 7 Aug, 7 Nov, 7 Feb, 7 May, 31 Jan |

### What Stays the Same

MTD changes **how** you report, not **what** you owe:

- Tax rates remain the same (20%, 40%, 45%)
- Allowable expenses remain the same
- National Insurance calculations unchanged
- Payment dates unchanged (31 January, 31 July)
- Personal Allowance unchanged (£12,570)

## Self-Employment Expenses Under MTD

Your quarterly submissions include expenses by category. Common self-employment expense categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Cost of goods sold | Materials, stock, subcontractors |
| Office costs | Stationery, software, phone (business portion) |
| Travel | Mileage, public transport, parking |
| Professional fees | Accountant, legal, consultants |
| Marketing | Advertising, website, business cards |
| Premises | Rent, utilities, business rates |
| Staff costs | Wages, employer NI, pensions |
| Financial costs | Bank charges, card fees, interest |
| Home office | Simplified expenses or actual costs |

### Simplified Expenses for Self-Employed

MTD-compatible software should support HMRC's simplified expenses:

**Vehicle Mileage:**
| Miles | Rate |
|-------|------|
| First 10,000/year | 45p per mile |
| Over 10,000 | 25p per mile |

**Home Office:**
| Hours worked from home/month | Flat rate |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| 25-50 hours | £10/month |
| 51-100 hours | £18/month |
| 101+ hours | £26/month |

## How to Prepare for MTD

### Step 1: Check Your Income

Review your gross self-employment income for recent tax years:

- 2023/24: Check your SA103 turnover figure
- 2024/25: Estimate based on current trading

If you're close to a threshold, err on the side of caution and prepare.

### Step 2: Choose MTD Software

Select HMRC-recognised software that suits your needs:

| Consider | Questions to Ask |
|----------|------------------|
| Bank connections | Does it connect to my bank via Open Banking? |
| Ease of use | Is it simple enough for my needs? |
| Expense categorisation | Does it auto-categorise transactions? |
| Price | What's the annual cost? |
| Support | Is UK-based help available? |

[Compare MTD software options](/making-tax-digital/software)

### Step 3: Connect Your Bank

Most MTD software uses Open Banking to import transactions automatically:

1. Link your business bank account(s)
2. Transactions import daily
3. Categorise as income or expenses
4. Software calculates totals for submission

### Step 4: Establish Digital Records

Before MTD starts:

1. Import historical transactions (if software supports it)
2. Categorise existing 2025/26 transactions
3. Set up expense categories matching HMRC requirements
4. Practice categorising new transactions

### Step 5: Submit a Test Quarter

If your software offers it, submit a test quarterly update:

1. Review the submission process
2. Understand what data is sent to HMRC
3. Identify any gaps in your records
4. Build confidence before the real deadline

## Common Self-Employed MTD Questions

### Do I need an accountant for MTD?

For straightforward self-employment, MTD software handles everything. Consider an accountant if you have:

- Multiple businesses
- Complex tax situations
- Limited time for administration
- Preference for professional oversight

Many accountants offer MTD support services—they can review your submissions before filing.

### What if my income fluctuates around the threshold?

The threshold is based on income in the **previous tax year**. If your 2025/26 income exceeds £50,000, you must comply from April 2026 regardless of what you earn in 2026/27.

If your income drops below the threshold for two consecutive years, you can leave MTD.

### Can I use my phone for MTD?

Yes. Most MTD software has mobile apps for:

- Capturing receipts
- Reviewing transactions
- Checking your tax position
- Submitting quarterly updates (some apps)

TaxFolio works on iOS and Android.

### What about cash transactions?

Record cash income and expenses the same as bank transactions:

1. Keep receipts for cash expenses
2. Record cash income when received
3. Enter manually in your MTD software
4. Include in quarterly submissions

A separate business bank account makes record-keeping simpler.

### I'm already using accounting software—do I need to change?

Check if your current software is MTD-recognised:

- **Yes, MTD-ready:** You may just need to enable MTD features
- **Not MTD-ready:** Switch to recognised software before April 2026

## MTD Penalties for Self-Employed

Late quarterly submissions incur penalty points:

| Late Submissions | Points | Penalty |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| 1st late | 1 | None |
| 2nd late | 2 | None |
| 3rd late | 3 | None |
| 4th late | 4 | **£200** |
| 5th+ late | 5+ | £200 each |

Points expire after **24 months of on-time submissions** (8 consecutive quarterly updates).

### Avoiding Penalties

1. Set calendar reminders 14 days before each deadline
2. Use software with automatic deadline notifications
3. Submit a few days early—don't wait until the deadline
4. Keep records current weekly, not quarterly

## Self-Employed MTD Exemptions

You may be exempt from MTD if:

### Digital Exclusion

You cannot use digital tools due to:
- Age
- Disability
- Remote location without internet
- Religious beliefs

Apply to HMRC for an exemption.

### Below the Threshold

If your gross income is below the current threshold, MTD doesn't apply (though you can volunteer).

### Ceasing Trading

If you stop self-employment, inform HMRC. You won't need to submit future MTD returns.
