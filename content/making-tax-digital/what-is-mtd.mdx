Making Tax Digital (MTD) is a UK government initiative requiring self-employed individuals and landlords to keep digital records and submit quarterly updates to HMRC using compatible software. MTD replaces the traditional annual Self Assessment tax return with more frequent digital reporting.

MTD for Income Tax becomes mandatory on **6 April 2026** for those with gross income over £50,000, and **6 April 2027** for those earning over £30,000.

## What Making Tax Digital Means in Practice

Under MTD, the way you report your income to HMRC changes fundamentally:

| Traditional Self Assessment | Making Tax Digital |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Keep paper or digital records | Keep digital records only |
| File once per year (31 January) | Submit quarterly + final declaration |
| Software optional | HMRC-recognised software required |
| Manual calculations acceptable | Software must calculate tax |
| No real-time visibility | See your tax position throughout the year |

MTD does not change **what** you pay—it changes **how** you report.

## Why HMRC Introduced MTD

HMRC introduced Making Tax Digital to:

1. **Reduce errors** — Manual record-keeping and calculations cause mistakes. HMRC estimates MTD will reduce the £8.5 billion annual "tax gap" from errors and carelessness.

2. **Modernise tax administration** — Paper records and annual filing are outdated. MTD brings UK tax reporting in line with digital banking and accounting.

3. **Improve compliance** — Quarterly reporting catches issues earlier, before they become large problems at year-end.

4. **Provide real-time visibility** — You see your tax position throughout the year, reducing January surprises.

According to [HMRC's MTD impact assessment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital-for-income-tax), the initiative aims to make tax administration "more effective, more efficient, and easier for taxpayers."

## Who Must Comply with MTD

MTD for Income Tax Self Assessment (MTD ITSA) applies to:

### Self-Employed Sole Traders

If you run a business as a sole trader and your gross self-employment income exceeds the threshold, you must comply with MTD.

Examples:
- Freelance designers, writers, consultants
- Tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, builders)
- Delivery drivers (Uber, Deliveroo, Amazon Flex)
- Online sellers (eBay, Etsy, Amazon)

### Landlords

If you receive rental income from UK property and your gross property income exceeds the threshold, you must comply with MTD.

This includes:
- Buy-to-let landlords
- Airbnb and short-term rental hosts
- Those renting out a spare room (if income exceeds £7,500 Rent a Room threshold)

### Combined Income

If you have **both** self-employment and property income, your combined gross income determines whether you must comply.

**Example:** You earn £30,000 from freelancing and £25,000 from rental property. Your combined income of £55,000 means you must comply from April 2026.

## MTD Income Thresholds

| Compliance Date | Gross Income Threshold |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 6 April 2026 | Over £50,000 |
| 6 April 2027 | Over £30,000 |
| TBC | Over £20,000 |

**Important:** The threshold is based on **gross income** (total receipts), not profit. If your business turns over £60,000 but your profit after expenses is £30,000, you still must comply in April 2026.

## What MTD Requires You to Do

### 1. Keep Digital Records

You must maintain digital records of all:

- Business income received
- Allowable business expenses
- The date, amount, and category of each transaction

"Digital" means using software—spreadsheets alone do not qualify unless paired with bridging software that submits to HMRC.

### 2. Use HMRC-Recognised Software

Your software must be on [HMRC's list of recognised MTD software](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax). The software must:

- Store records digitally
- Calculate your tax position
- Connect to HMRC via the MTD API
- Submit quarterly updates and the final declaration

TaxFolio is HMRC-recognised MTD software built for UK self-employed and landlords.

### 3. Submit Quarterly Updates

Every three months, you submit a summary of your income and expenses to HMRC:

| Quarter | Period | Deadline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Q1 | 6 April – 5 July | 7 August |
| Q2 | 6 July – 5 October | 7 November |
| Q3 | 6 October – 5 January | 7 February |
| Q4 | 6 January – 5 April | 7 May |

Quarterly updates are summaries—you don't need to submit every receipt.

### 4. File a Final Declaration

After the tax year ends, you submit a final declaration by **31 January**, confirming:

- Total income for the year
- All allowable expenses and reliefs
- Any adjustments
- Your final tax liability

This replaces the traditional Self Assessment return.

## What MTD Does NOT Change

MTD changes how you report, not what you owe:

- **Tax rates** remain the same (20%, 40%, 45%)
- **Allowable expenses** remain the same
- **Payment dates** remain the same (31 January, 31 July)
- **National Insurance** calculations remain the same
- **Personal Allowance** remains the same (£12,570)

You may see your tax position more clearly throughout the year, but the amount you owe is calculated the same way.

## MTD Software Requirements

To comply with MTD, your software must:

| Requirement | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| HMRC-recognised | Listed on GOV.UK's approved software list |
| Digital record storage | Stores income and expenses electronically |
| Tax calculations | Calculates Income Tax and National Insurance |
| MTD API connection | Submits directly to HMRC (no manual upload) |
| Quarterly submissions | Can send Q1-Q4 updates |
| Final declaration | Can submit year-end confirmation |

### Software Options

**Full MTD Software** (recommended):
- TaxFolio, FreeAgent, QuickBooks, Xero, Sage
- Handles everything: records, calculations, submissions
- Connects to your bank via Open Banking

**Bridging Software**:
- Connects spreadsheets to HMRC
- You maintain records in Excel/Google Sheets
- Software formats and submits data

## MTD Exemptions

Some people are exempt from MTD:

### Digital Exclusion

If you cannot use computers or the internet due to:
- Age
- Disability
- Remote location without internet access
- Religious beliefs

You must apply to HMRC for an exemption.

### Below the Threshold

If your gross income is below the current threshold, you're not required to use MTD (though you can voluntarily).

### Insolvency

Those who are insolvent may be exempt.

## MTD Penalties

HMRC uses a points-based penalty system for late submissions:

| Late Submissions | Consequence |
|------------------|-------------|
| 1st late | 1 point (warning) |
| 2nd late | 2 points (warning) |
| 3rd late | 3 points (warning) |
| 4th late | 4 points + **£200 penalty** |
| 5th+ late | £200 per additional late submission |

Points expire after 24 months of on-time submissions.

Late payment penalties are separate and based on how overdue your tax payment is.

2. Connect your bank accounts
3. Start categorising transactions

**Before April 2026:**
1. Ensure historical records are digital
2. Practice a test quarterly submission
3. Set up deadline reminders

**From April 2026:**
1. Keep all records digitally
2. Submit Q1 by 7 August 2026
3. Continue quarterly submissions

### If You're in the April 2027 Wave (Income Over £30,000)

You have more time, but starting early means:
- Learning the system without deadline pressure
- Identifying gaps in your record-keeping
- Getting comfortable with quarterly reporting

## MTD for Different Business Types

### Sole Traders

Report self-employment income on the SA103 section. Your MTD software tracks:
- All business income
- Allowable expenses by category
- Capital allowances

Learn more: [Sole Trader Tax Guide](/sole-trader-tax)

### Landlords

Report property income on the SA105 section. Your MTD software tracks:
- Rental income by property
- Property expenses
- Mortgage interest (for 20% tax credit)

Learn more: [Landlord Tax Guide](/landlord-tax)

### Multiple Income Sources

If you have both self-employment and property income, report both through MTD. Your software should handle multiple income types in one submission.

TaxFolio supports both SA103 and SA105 in a single account.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I still need an accountant with MTD?

For straightforward tax affairs, MTD software like TaxFolio can handle everything. Complex situations (multiple businesses, overseas income, tax planning) may still benefit from professional advice.

### Can I use my phone for MTD?

Yes—most MTD software has mobile apps. TaxFolio works on iOS and Android for receipt capture and transaction review.

### What if I miss a quarterly deadline?

You receive a penalty point. At 4 points, you get a £200 fine. Try to submit on time, but one missed deadline won't immediately cost you money.

### Is MTD the same as Self Assessment?

MTD replaces the reporting part of Self Assessment. Instead of one annual return, you submit quarterly updates plus a final declaration. The tax calculations remain the same.
