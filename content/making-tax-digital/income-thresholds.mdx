  - question: "What is the MTD income threshold?"
    answer: "MTD applies to those with gross income over £50,000 from 6 April 2026, and over £30,000 from 6 April 2027. The threshold is based on gross income (total receipts before expenses), not profit."
  - question: "Is the MTD threshold based on profit or turnover?"
    answer: "The MTD threshold is based on gross income (turnover), not profit. If your business receives £60,000 but expenses are £25,000, your gross income is £60,000—you must comply even though profit is only £35,000."
  - question: "What if I have both self-employment and rental income?"
    answer: "Self-employment and property income are combined to determine if you meet the MTD threshold. If your combined gross income from both sources exceeds £50,000 (from April 2026) or £30,000 (from April 2027), you must comply with MTD."
  - question: "Which tax year determines if I need MTD?"
    answer: "Your qualifying income in the previous tax year determines whether you must use MTD. If your 2025/26 gross income exceeds £50,000, you must comply with MTD from 6 April 2026."

The MTD income threshold determines who must comply with Making Tax Digital for Income Tax. From **6 April 2026**, individuals with gross income over **£50,000** must use MTD. From **6 April 2027**, the threshold drops to **£30,000**. A further reduction to £20,000 is planned but not yet confirmed.

This guide explains how thresholds work, what counts as qualifying income, and how combined income sources affect your obligations.

## MTD Threshold Timeline

| Start Date | Gross Income Threshold | Who Must Comply |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 6 April 2026 | Over £50,000 | ~780,000 taxpayers |
| 6 April 2027 | Over £30,000 | ~1.8 million additional |
| TBC (likely 2028) | Over £20,000 | Further expansion |

These thresholds apply to self-employed individuals and landlords with qualifying income.

## Gross Income, Not Profit

The most important concept: **MTD thresholds are based on gross income, not profit**.

### What is Gross Income?

Gross income means your total business receipts before deducting any expenses:

| Gross Income Includes | Gross Income Does NOT Include |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| All sales revenue | Business expenses |
| Client payments | Cost of goods sold |
| Rental income received | Mortgage payments |
| Tips and gratuities | Equipment purchases |
| Grants and subsidies | Professional fees |
| Commission income | Travel costs |

### Why This Matters

**Example: High Turnover, Low Profit**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Business income (gross) | £75,000 |
| Business expenses | £45,000 |
| **Profit** | **£30,000** |

Despite making only £30,000 profit, this person must comply with MTD from April 2026 because gross income exceeds £50,000.

**Example: Lower Turnover, Higher Profit**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Business income (gross) | £45,000 |
| Business expenses | £8,000 |
| **Profit** | **£37,000** |

This person does NOT need MTD until April 2027 (when the £30,000 threshold applies), despite making more profit than the first example.

## Qualifying Income Sources

### Self-Employment Income

All trading income from self-employment counts towards the threshold:

- Freelance earnings
- Sole trader business receipts
- Contract/consulting income
- Gig economy earnings (Uber, Deliveroo, etc.)
- Online selling (if trading, not occasional sales)

### Property Income

All rental income counts towards the threshold:

- Buy-to-let rent
- Airbnb and short-term rental income
- Room rental (if above Rent a Room £7,500 threshold)
- Commercial property rent
- Holiday let income

### What Does NOT Count

These income sources do NOT count towards the MTD threshold:

| Income Type | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Employment salary (PAYE) | Taxed at source |
| Pension income | Taxed at source |
| Dividends | Different reporting system |
| Bank interest | Taxed via Personal Savings Allowance |
| Capital gains | Separate CGT rules |

MTD for Income Tax focuses on self-assessment income that isn't taxed at source.

## Combined Income Rules

If you have multiple qualifying income sources, they're added together:

### Self-Employment + Property

| Income Source | Gross Amount |
|---------------|--------------|
| Freelance business | £35,000 |
| Rental property | £20,000 |
| **Combined total** | **£55,000** |

This person must comply from April 2026 (combined income over £50,000), even though neither source alone exceeds the threshold.

### Multiple Self-Employments

If you run multiple businesses as a sole trader:

| Business | Gross Income |
|----------|--------------|
| Consulting business | £28,000 |
| Online store | £15,000 |
| Photography side business | £12,000 |
| **Combined total** | **£55,000** |

All self-employment income combines—this person must comply from April 2026.

### Multiple Rental Properties

All rental income is already treated as one property business, so properties naturally combine:

| Property | Gross Rent |
|----------|------------|
| Property 1 | £18,000 |
| Property 2 | £15,000 |
| Property 3 | £22,000 |
| **Combined total** | **£55,000** |

## Which Tax Year Determines Compliance?

Your **qualifying income** from the previous tax year determines whether you must use MTD.

### For April 2026 Start

Your 2024/25 income (6 April 2024 – 5 April 2025) determines if you comply from April 2026:

| 2024/25 Gross Income | MTD from April 2026? |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Over £50,000 | Yes, must comply |
| Under £50,000 | No (unless 2025/26 exceeds £50,000) |

If your income rises above £50,000 during 2025/26, you'll join MTD from April 2026 based on that year's income.

### For April 2027 Start

Your 2025/26 income determines if you comply from April 2027:

| 2025/26 Gross Income | MTD from April 2027? |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Over £50,000 | Already in MTD from 2026 |
| £30,001 – £50,000 | Yes, must comply |
| Under £30,000 | No (unless income rises) |

## Threshold Examples

### Example 1: Clear First Wave

**Sophie: Graphic Designer**
- 2024/25 gross income: £62,000
- Expenses: £12,000
- Profit: £50,000

**Result:** Gross income exceeds £50,000. Sophie must comply with MTD from **6 April 2026**.

### Example 2: Clear Second Wave

**Tom: Part-Time Consultant**
- 2024/25 gross income: £38,000
- Expenses: £6,000
- Profit: £32,000

**Result:** Gross income is between £30,000 and £50,000. Tom must comply with MTD from **6 April 2027**.

### Example 3: Combined Income

**Emma: Employed with Side Business and Rental**
- Employment income: £45,000 (PAYE—doesn't count)
- Freelance income: £28,000 (counts)
- Rental income: £24,000 (counts)
- **Qualifying income: £52,000**

**Result:** Combined self-employment and property income exceeds £50,000. Emma must comply from **6 April 2026**.

### Example 4: Below Threshold

**James: New Freelancer**
- 2024/25 gross income: £25,000
- Expenses: £3,000
- Profit: £22,000

**Result:** Gross income below £30,000. James does not need MTD until the threshold potentially drops to £20,000 (or his income increases).

### Example 5: Rising Income

**Lucy: Growing Business**
- 2024/25 gross income: £42,000 (below £50,000)
- 2025/26 gross income: £58,000 (above £50,000)

**Result:** Lucy didn't qualify based on 2024/25, but her 2025/26 income exceeds £50,000. She must comply from **6 April 2026** based on her qualifying income that year.

## Fluctuating Income

### Income Rises Above Threshold

If your income rises above the current threshold, you must join MTD from the following April.

**Example:**
- 2025/26: £48,000 (below £50,000 threshold)
- 2026/27: £53,000 (above £50,000 threshold)
- **Result:** Must join MTD from 6 April 2027

### Income Falls Below Threshold

If your income drops below the threshold for **two consecutive tax years**, you can leave MTD.

**Example:**
- 2026/27: £55,000 (in MTD)
- 2027/28: £45,000 (below £50,000)
- 2028/29: £42,000 (below £50,000 for second year)
- **Result:** Can leave MTD from 6 April 2029

Note: As thresholds are dropping, leaving MTD becomes less likely over time.

## Near the Threshold: What to Do

If your income is close to a threshold, consider:

### If Just Under £50,000

- **Don't artificially suppress income**—HMRC may investigate
- **Prepare anyway**—income may rise, and the £30,000 threshold is coming
- **Consider voluntary MTD**—get ahead of requirements

### If Just Over £50,000

- **You must comply**—no choice if above threshold
- **Legitimate expense claims** may reduce profit (not gross income)
- **Start preparing now**—deadlines are approaching

### Voluntary MTD

You can join MTD voluntarily even if below the threshold. Benefits:
- Learn the system without pressure
- Quarterly visibility of your tax position
- No penalty if you make mistakes while learning

## How HMRC Knows Your Income

HMRC has multiple data sources:

| Source | What They See |
|--------|---------------|
| Self Assessment returns | Your declared gross income |
| Bank data | Transaction patterns (not direct access yet) |
| Letting agent reports | Rental income reported to HMRC |
| Third-party platforms | Airbnb, eBay, Etsy, Uber, Deliveroo reports |
| Property records | Land Registry data on ownership |

From 2024, digital platforms must report seller/host income to HMRC, making it easier to identify those above thresholds.

## MTD Exemptions

Regardless of income, you may be exempt if:

### Digital Exclusion

You cannot use digital tools due to:
- Age
- Disability
- Remote location without internet
- Religious beliefs

Apply to HMRC for an exemption.

### Insolvency

Those who are insolvent may be exempt from MTD requirements.

### Leaving Self-Employment

If you cease trading or sell all rental properties, you exit MTD.

## Planning for Threshold Changes

### Current Timeline

| Date | Threshold | Your Action |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Now | N/A | Check your gross income |
| April 2026 | £50,000 | First wave compliance |
| April 2027 | £30,000 | Second wave compliance |
| TBC | £20,000 | Further expansion |

### Recommendations

**If income over £50,000:**
- Choose MTD software now
- Set up digital record-keeping
- Practice with current tax year data

**If income £30,000-£50,000:**
- You have until April 2027
- Start preparing in 2026
- Watch first wave for lessons learned

**If income under £30,000:**
- No immediate action required
- Stay aware of threshold changes
- Consider voluntary MTD for practice

## Summary: Quick Reference

| Your Situation | MTD Start Date |
|----------------|----------------|
| Gross income over £50,000 | 6 April 2026 |
| Gross income £30,001-£50,000 | 6 April 2027 |
| Gross income £20,001-£30,000 | TBC (likely 2028+) |
| Gross income under £20,000 | Not yet required |
| Employment only (PAYE) | MTD doesn't apply |
| Properties in limited company | MTD ITSA doesn't apply |

**Key points:**
- Threshold = **gross income**, not profit
- Self-employment + property income = **combined**
- Employment income = **doesn't count**
- Falling below threshold = need **2 consecutive years** to exit
