Making Tax Digital (MTD) requires MTD-compatible software to maintain digital records and submit quarterly updates. You cannot use paper records or spreadsheets alone—you need software that connects to HMRC's MTD API.

This guide compares MTD software options for self-employed individuals and landlords, with features, pricing, and recommendations for different use cases.

## MTD Software Requirements

1. **Store digital records** of all income and expenses
2. **Calculate tax liability** accurately
3. **Submit quarterly updates** to HMRC via the MTD API
4. **File the final declaration** at year-end
5. **Maintain records** for the required 6-year period
