Understanding MTD deadlines is crucial for staying compliant and avoiding penalties. This guide covers all the key dates you need to know.

## When MTD Becomes Mandatory

Making Tax Digital for Income Tax rolls out in phases based on your income:

### April 2026 - First Wave
- Self-employed individuals with gross income over **£50,000**
- Landlords with property income over **£50,000**
- Approximately 780,000 taxpayers affected

### April 2027 - Second Wave
- Self-employed with gross income over **£30,000**
- Landlords with property income over **£30,000**
- Brings total to around 1.1 million taxpayers

### Future Phases
HMRC plans to eventually extend MTD to those earning over £20,000, but no date has been confirmed.

## Quarterly Update Deadlines

Under MTD, you must submit four quarterly updates each tax year:

| Quarter | Period Covered | Submission Deadline |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Q1 | 6 April - 5 July | 7 August |
| Q2 | 6 July - 5 October | 7 November |
| Q3 | 6 October - 5 January | 7 February |
| Q4 | 6 January - 5 April | 7 May |

You have approximately one month after each quarter ends to submit your update.

## End of Year Deadlines

After the tax year ends, you have additional obligations:

### Final Declaration
- **Deadline:** 31 January following the tax year end
- This replaces the traditional Self Assessment return
- Confirms your total income, expenses, and any adjustments

### Payment Deadlines
- **31 January** - Balance of tax owed
- **31 July** - First payment on account (if applicable)

## Penalty System

HMRC uses a points-based penalty system for late submissions:

### How Points Work
- Each late quarterly update = 1 penalty point
- Threshold: 4 points
- Once you reach 4 points: £200 penalty
- Further late submissions: Additional £200 each

### Removing Points
Points expire after 24 months of timely submissions (for quarterly updates).

### Late Payment Penalties
Separate from submission penalties:
- 15 days late: First penalty charge
- 30 days late: Additional charge
- Interest accrues from the due date

## First Year Timeline (2026/27)

If you're in the first wave (income over £50,000), here's your first MTD year:

| Date | Action Required |
|------|-----------------|
| 6 April 2026 | MTD starts - begin keeping digital records |
| 7 August 2026 | Submit Q1 update |
| 7 November 2026 | Submit Q2 update |
| 7 February 2027 | Submit Q3 update |
| 7 May 2027 | Submit Q4 update |
| 31 January 2028 | Final declaration and payment |
