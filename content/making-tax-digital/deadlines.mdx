Making Tax Digital (MTD) for Income Tax becomes mandatory on 6 April 2026 for self-employed individuals and landlords with gross income over £50,000. Those earning over £30,000 must comply from 6 April 2027.

This guide provides every deadline you need to know for MTD compliance, including quarterly submission dates, payment deadlines, and the penalty system.

## When MTD Becomes Mandatory

MTD for Income Tax Self Assessment (MTD ITSA) rolls out in phases based on gross income:

### 6 April 2026: First Wave

- Self-employed with gross income over **£50,000**
- Landlords with gross property income over **£50,000**
- Combined self-employment and property income over **£50,000**

According to [HMRC estimates](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital-for-income-tax), approximately 780,000 taxpayers fall into this threshold.

### 6 April 2027: Second Wave

- Self-employed with gross income over **£30,000**
- Landlords with gross property income over **£30,000**
- Combined income over **£30,000**

This brings total MTD-affected taxpayers to approximately 1.75 million.

### Future Phases

HMRC plans to extend MTD to those earning over £20,000, but no date has been confirmed.

## MTD Quarterly Submission Deadlines

Under MTD, you submit four quarterly updates per tax year, plus a final declaration. Each quarterly update summarises your income and expenses for that three-month period.

### Quarterly Update Calendar

| Quarter | Period Covered | Deadline |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Q1 | 6 April – 5 July | 7 August |
| Q2 | 6 July – 5 October | 7 November |
| Q3 | 6 October – 5 January | 7 February |
| Q4 | 6 January – 5 April | 7 May |

You have approximately one month after each quarter ends to submit your update to HMRC.

### Final Declaration Deadline

After submitting all four quarterly updates, you must file a final declaration by **31 January** following the end of the tax year. This replaces the traditional Self Assessment tax return and confirms:

- Your total income for the year
- All allowable expenses
- Any adjustments or reliefs
- Your final tax liability

## First MTD Year: 2026/27 Timeline

If your gross income exceeds £50,000, here is your complete first-year MTD schedule:

| Date | Action Required |
|------|-----------------|
| **6 April 2026** | MTD begins—start keeping digital records |
| **7 August 2026** | Submit Q1 update (6 Apr – 5 Jul) |
| **7 November 2026** | Submit Q2 update (6 Jul – 5 Oct) |
| **7 February 2027** | Submit Q3 update (6 Oct – 5 Jan) |
| **7 May 2027** | Submit Q4 update (6 Jan – 5 Apr) |
| **31 January 2028** | File final declaration and pay tax |

## Payment Deadlines

MTD does not change when you pay tax—only how you report. Payment deadlines remain:

### Tax Payment Schedule

| Payment | Deadline |
|---------|----------|
| Balance of tax owed | 31 January |
| First payment on account | 31 January |
| Second payment on account | 31 July |

Payments on account apply if your tax bill exceeds £1,000 and less than 80% was deducted at source through PAYE.

## MTD Penalty System

HMRC uses a points-based penalty system for late MTD submissions, separate from late payment penalties.

### Late Submission Penalties

| Penalty Points | Consequence |
|----------------|-------------|
| 1 point | Warning—no financial penalty |
| 2 points | Warning—no financial penalty |
| 3 points | Warning—no financial penalty |
| 4 points | **£200 penalty** |
| 5+ points | £200 per additional late submission |

For quarterly submissions (4 per year), the penalty threshold is 4 points. This means you could miss three quarterly deadlines before incurring a financial penalty—though this is not recommended.

### How Points Expire

Penalty points expire after **24 months of consecutive on-time submissions**. For quarterly reporting, this means 8 consecutive on-time quarterly updates.

Once you reach the penalty threshold and pay the £200 fine, you must submit 24 months of on-time updates before your points reset to zero.

### Late Payment Penalties

Separate from submission penalties, late payment of tax incurs:

| Days Late | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| 1-15 days | Interest accrues |
| 16-30 days | 2% of tax outstanding |
| 31+ days | Additional 2% (4% total) |
| 31+ days | Additional daily penalty begins |

Interest on late payments accrues from the original due date at the [HMRC late payment interest rate](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates-for-late-and-early-payments).

## Second MTD Year: 2027/28 Timeline

For those in the second wave (income £30,000-£50,000), MTD begins 6 April 2027:

| Date | Action Required |
|------|-----------------|
| **6 April 2027** | MTD begins—start keeping digital records |
| **7 August 2027** | Submit Q1 update |
| **7 November 2027** | Submit Q2 update |
| **7 February 2028** | Submit Q3 update |
| **7 May 2028** | Submit Q4 update |
| **31 January 2029** | File final declaration and pay tax |

2. **Verify bank connections**—ensure transactions import correctly
3. **Set up reminders**—calendar alerts for each deadline

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if my income fluctuates around the threshold?

Your threshold is based on gross income in the preceding tax year. If your income was over £50,000 in 2024/25, you must comply with MTD from April 2026—even if income drops below £50,000 in 2025/26.

### Can I submit quarterly updates early?

Yes. You can submit any time during the quarter or after it ends, as long as you meet the deadline.

### Do I still file a Self Assessment return under MTD?

The final declaration replaces the traditional Self Assessment return. You file quarterly updates throughout the year, then a final declaration by 31 January.

### What if I have both employment and self-employment income?

Your employed income (taxed through PAYE) is reported separately by your employer. Your MTD obligations cover only your self-employment and property income.
