Self-employed individuals must keep business records for at least **6 years** after the tax year they relate to. HMRC requires records of all income, expenses, and supporting documentation. Good records help you complete accurate tax returns, claim all allowable expenses, and defend your figures if HMRC enquires.

This guide explains what records to keep, how long to keep them, and the best ways to stay organised.

## How Long to Keep Records

### The 6-Year Rule

Keep all business records for **6 years** after the end of the relevant tax year:

| Tax Year | Records Relate To | Keep Until |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| 2024/25 | 6 Apr 2024 – 5 Apr 2025 | 5 April 2031 |
| 2025/26 | 6 Apr 2025 – 5 Apr 2026 | 5 April 2032 |
| 2026/27 | 6 Apr 2026 – 5 Apr 2027 | 5 April 2033 |

### Why 6 Years?

HMRC can open an enquiry into your tax return for:

| Situation | Time Limit |
|-----------|------------|
| Random check | 12 months from filing |
| Careless error | 6 years |
| Deliberate error | 20 years |

The 6-year rule covers most situations. If you suspect errors in past returns, consider keeping records longer.

### When to Keep Longer

Consider keeping records beyond 6 years if:

- HMRC has opened an enquiry
- You have complex tax affairs
- Records relate to assets you still own (for CGT)
- You've made losses to carry forward

|-------------|----------|
| Sales invoices | Invoices you issued to clients |

| VAT invoices issued | With VAT number and amounts |
| VAT invoices received | For input VAT claims |

## Digital vs Paper Records

### HMRC Accepts Both

You can keep records in any format:

|--------|-------------|
| Paper receipts | Yes |
| Scanned receipts | Yes |
| Photographs of receipts | Yes |
| Accounting software records | Yes |
| Spreadsheets | Yes |

| Email invoices | Yes |

### Why Digital is Better

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Doesn't fade** | Paper receipts fade; digital lasts |
| **Searchable** | Find records quickly |
| **Backup possible** | Cloud storage protects against loss |
| **Less storage space** | No boxes of paper |
| **MTD-ready** | Required from April 2026/2027 |

### Making Tax Digital Requirements

From **April 2026** (income over £50,000) or **April 2027** (over £30,000), [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital) requires:

- Digital record keeping
- Records stored in compatible software
- Quarterly submissions to HMRC

Even if not yet required, adopting digital records now prepares you for MTD.

## Organising Your Records

### By Category

Create folders (physical or digital) for:

```
Business Records 2024-25/
├── Income/
│   ├── Invoices issued/
│   └── Sales records/
├── Expenses/
│   ├── Office costs/
│   ├── Travel/
│   ├── Professional fees/
│   └── Equipment/
├── Bank statements/
├── Mileage log/
└── Tax returns/
```

### By Date

Alternatively, organise chronologically:

```
2024-25/
├── April 2024/
├── May 2024/
├── ...
└── March 2025/
```

### Using Accounting Software

Most software organises records automatically:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Bank feed import | Transactions downloaded daily |
| Receipt capture | Photograph and attach to transactions |
| Automatic categorisation | AI sorts expenses |
| Search function | Find any record quickly |
| Export capability | Download for backup or HMRC |

TaxFolio stores records digitally and maintains them for 6+ years.

## Record Keeping Best Practices

### 1. Record Immediately

Don't let receipts pile up. When you incur an expense:

1. Photograph the receipt immediately
2. Upload to your software or folder
3. Categorise it
4. Discard paper (optional, if digital copy clear)

### 2. Separate Business and Personal

Use a dedicated business bank account:

- Clear separation of transactions
- Easier to identify business expenses
- Simpler record keeping
- More professional appearance

### 3. Back Up Regularly

Protect against data loss:

| Method | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Cloud storage (automatic) | Real-time |
| External hard drive | Monthly |
| Accounting software backup | Automatic |
| Email copies of key docs | As needed |

### 4. Review Monthly

Set a monthly reminder to:

- Reconcile bank statements
- Categorise any uncategorised transactions
- Capture any outstanding receipts
- Check income matches invoices issued

### 5. Year-End Review

Before filing your tax return:

- Review all expense categories
- Check for missing income
- Verify mileage log is complete
- Ensure all receipts are stored

## What Happens If Records Are Inadequate

### HMRC Enquiry

If HMRC enquires and your records are poor:

| Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Expense claims disallowed | Pay more tax |
| Income estimated higher | Pay more tax |
| Interest charged | On underpaid tax |
| Penalties applied | Percentage of unpaid tax |

### Record Keeping Penalties

HMRC can charge penalties for inadequate record keeping:

| Situation | Maximum Penalty |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Failure to keep adequate records | £3,000 |
| Failure to preserve records | £3,000 |

These are in addition to any tax and interest from incorrect returns.

### Reasonable Excuse

Penalties may be reduced or cancelled if you have a "reasonable excuse":

| May Be Acceptable | Probably Not Acceptable |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Records destroyed in fire/flood | Too busy to keep records |
| Serious illness | Didn't know requirements |
| Theft of records | Records were inconvenient |
| Death in family | Trusted someone else to keep them |

Even with a reasonable excuse, you must take steps to reconstruct records if possible.

## Reconstructing Lost Records

If records are lost, try to reconstruct:

### Bank Statements

Contact your bank for duplicate statements. Most banks provide:
- Online access to 7+ years of statements
- Paper copies for a fee
- PDF downloads

### Invoices

- Check email for invoice copies
- Contact clients for copies of invoices you issued
- Contact suppliers for copies of invoices they sent

### Receipts

- Credit card statements show where you spent money
- Bank statements show amounts
- Contact vendors for duplicate receipts

### Mileage

If mileage log is lost:
- Review calendar for business appointments
- Check emails for meeting confirmations
- Calculate distances using maps
- Document your reconstruction method
