faqs:
  - question: "What is digital record keeping for MTD?"
    answer: "Digital record keeping means maintaining your business records electronically using software that can submit data to HMRC via the MTD API. Spreadsheets alone don't qualify—you need MTD-compatible software or bridging software."
  - question: "Can I use spreadsheets for Making Tax Digital?"
    answer: "You can use spreadsheets to record transactions, but you'll need bridging software to submit data to HMRC. Full MTD software is simpler as it handles both record keeping and submission in one system."
  - question: "What software do I need for MTD?"
    answer: "You need MTD-compatible MTD software that stores digital records and submits quarterly updates. Options include TaxFolio, FreeAgent, QuickBooks, Xero, and Sage. Check HMRC's list of compatible software."
  - question: "When do I need to start digital record keeping?"
    answer: "If your income exceeds £50,000, start from 6 April 2026. If it exceeds £30,000, start from 6 April 2027. Setting up earlier gives you time to learn the system before compliance becomes mandatory."

Making Tax Digital (MTD) requires you to keep business records digitally using compatible software. From **6 April 2026** (income over £50,000) or **6 April 2027** (income over £30,000), you must maintain digital records that can submit quarterly updates to HMRC via the MTD API. Spreadsheets alone don't qualify—you need MTD-compatible software.

This guide explains what digital record keeping means, what systems qualify, and how to prepare.

## What is Digital Record Keeping?

Digital record keeping for MTD means:

| Requirement | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| Digital format | Records stored electronically, not paper |
| Functional compatible software | Software on HMRC's approved list |
| Digital links | Data flows digitally (no manual re-keying) |
| API submission | Software submits directly to HMRC |

### What's NOT Sufficient

| Method | MTD Compliant? |
|--------|----------------|
| Paper records | No |
| Spreadsheet only | No (need bridging software) |
| Typing figures into HMRC website | No |
| Generic accounting software (not MTD-enabled) | No |

### What IS Sufficient

| Method | MTD Compliant? |
|--------|----------------|
| MTD-compatible accounting software | Yes |
| Spreadsheet + bridging software | Yes |
| Software with HMRC API connection | Yes |

## MTD-Compatible Software

Software must be on [HMRC's list of recognised software](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax) to be MTD-compliant.

### What MTD Software Does

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Store records | Keeps income and expenses digitally |
| Categorise transactions | Organises by HMRC-required categories |
| Calculate totals | Summarises for quarterly submissions |
| Submit to HMRC | Sends data via the MTD API |
| Maintain digital links | No manual copying between systems |

### Popular MTD Software Options

| Software | Starting Price | Best For |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| TaxFolio | £69.99/year | Tax-focused, bank connection, AI categorisation |
| FreeAgent | £14.50/month | Invoicing + accounting |
| QuickBooks | £12/month | Established brand |
| Xero | £14/month | Comprehensive accounting |
| Sage | £12/month | Traditional accounting |

### Choosing Software

Consider:

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| Bank feeds | Does it connect to my bank? |
| Ease of use | Is it simple enough for my needs? |
| Price | What's the annual cost? |
| Features | Does it have what I need (mileage, property, etc.)? |
| Support | Is UK-based help available? |
| MTD status | Is it MTD-compatible for MTD ITSA? |

## Spreadsheets and Bridging Software

### Can I Still Use Spreadsheets?

Yes, but with limitations:

| Spreadsheet Use | Allowed? |
|-----------------|----------|
| Recording transactions | Yes |
| Calculating totals | Yes |
| Submitting to HMRC directly | No |

If you prefer spreadsheets, you'll need **bridging software** to submit.

### What is Bridging Software?

Bridging software connects your spreadsheet to HMRC:

1. You maintain records in your spreadsheet
2. Export data to the bridging software
3. Bridging software submits to HMRC via the API

### Spreadsheet + Bridging vs Full Software

| Aspect | Spreadsheet + Bridging | Full MTD Software |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Record keeping | Your spreadsheet | Built-in |
| Bank feeds | Manual entry | Automatic import |
| Submission | Via bridging software | Direct to HMRC |
| Complexity | Higher (two systems) | Lower (one system) |
| Cost | May be lower | Predictable annual fee |

**Recommendation:** For most self-employed and landlords, full MTD software is simpler than managing spreadsheets plus bridging.

## What Records to Keep Digitally

### Self-Employment Records

| Record Type | What to Store |
|-------------|---------------|
| Income | All sales, fees, payments received |
| Expenses | All business costs by category |
| Bank transactions | All business account activity |
| Mileage | Business journeys (if claiming) |
| Home office | Hours worked or costs apportioned |

### Property Income Records

| Record Type | What to Store |
|-------------|---------------|
| Rental income | All rent received by property |
| Property expenses | Repairs, insurance, agent fees |
| Mortgage interest | For Section 24 tax credit |
| Capital expenditure | Improvements for CGT |

### Record Categories

MTD submissions require expenses in HMRC categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Cost of goods sold | Materials, stock, subcontractors |
| Car, van, travel | Mileage or vehicle costs |
| Wages and salaries | Staff costs |
| Rent, rates, power | Premises costs |
| Repairs | Equipment/property maintenance |
| Phone | Telecommunications |
| Accountancy | Professional fees |
| Interest | Business loan interest |
| Other expenses | Anything else |

Your software should map transactions to these categories.

## Digital Links Requirement

### What Are Digital Links?

A digital link means data transfers electronically between systems without manual re-entry.

| Allowed | Not Allowed |
|---------|-------------|
| Automatic bank feed import | Typing from bank statement |
| Copy-paste between software | Typing figures from paper |
| API data transfer | Re-keying totals |
| CSV/Excel export/import | Manual calculation and entry |

### Why Digital Links Matter

HMRC wants to reduce errors from manual transcription. Digital links ensure:
- Accuracy (no typos)
- Audit trail (data flow is traceable)
- Integrity (figures match source)

### Practical Example

**Compliant workflow:**
1. Bank transaction imports automatically to software
2. You categorise the transaction
3. Software calculates quarterly totals
4. Software submits to HMRC

**Non-compliant workflow:**
1. You look at bank statement
2. Type figures into spreadsheet
3. Type totals into another system
4. Type into HMRC submission

## Setting Up Digital Record Keeping

### Step 1: Choose Your Software

Select MTD-compatible software that suits your needs.

[HMRC's recognised software list](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax)

### Step 2: Connect Your Bank

Most MTD software uses Open Banking:

1. Link your business bank account(s)
2. Authorise the connection
3. Transactions import automatically (usually daily)

**Benefits of bank connection:**
- No manual entry
- All transactions captured
- Digital link requirement satisfied

### Step 3: Set Up Categories

Configure expense categories to match your business:

- Review default categories
- Add custom categories if needed
- Set rules for recurring transactions

### Step 4: Import Historical Data

If switching from another system:

- Import previous transactions (CSV or direct)
- Categorise historical data
- Ensure continuity with previous years

### Step 5: Establish Routine

For ongoing record keeping:

| Frequency | Task |
|-----------|------|
| Daily/weekly | Review and categorise new transactions |
| Monthly | Reconcile bank statements |
| Quarterly | Review totals, submit MTD update |
| Annually | Final declaration, archive records |

## Preparing for MTD

### If Required from April 2026 (Income Over £50,000)

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| Now | Choose MTD software |
| Q1 2026 | Set up and test software |
| 6 April 2026 | Begin digital record keeping |
| 7 August 2026 | First quarterly submission |

### If Required from April 2027 (Income Over £30,000)

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2026 | Observe first wave, choose software |
| Q1 2027 | Set up and test |
| 6 April 2027 | Begin digital record keeping |
| 7 August 2027 | First quarterly submission |

### Voluntary Early Adoption

You can adopt MTD voluntarily before it's required:
- Learn the system without pressure
- No penalties for mistakes while voluntary
- Build good habits early

## Digital Records vs Paper Backup

### Do I Need Paper Records?

No. HMRC accepts fully digital records. You don't need to print or keep paper copies if you have reliable digital storage.

### Best Practices for Digital Storage

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Cloud storage | Access anywhere, automatic backup |
| Regular backups | Protection against data loss |
| Organised folders | Easy retrieval if needed |
| Retain for 6 years | HMRC requirement |

### What About Receipts?

| Original Format | Digital Approach |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Paper receipt | Photograph or scan, store digitally |
| Email invoice | Keep in organised folder |
| PDF statement | Store as-is |
| Online purchase | Screenshot or download receipt |

Once digitised, you can discard paper originals (though some people prefer to keep them).

## Common Digital Record Keeping Mistakes

### 1. Waiting Until the Last Minute

Don't start digital record keeping the week before MTD begins. Set up months in advance.

### 2. Not Connecting the Bank

Manual entry defeats the purpose. Use Open Banking for automatic, compliant data import.

### 3. Irregular Categorisation

Review transactions regularly. Don't let months of uncategorised transactions pile up.

### 4. No Backup Strategy

Cloud software usually backs up automatically. If using local software, ensure you have backups.

### 5. Using Non-Compatible Software

Verify your software is on HMRC's recognised list. Generic software may not support MTD submission.

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection

MTD software stores sensitive financial data. Look for:

| Security Feature | Why It Matters |
|------------------|----------------|
| Encryption | Protects data in transit and storage |
| Two-factor authentication | Prevents unauthorised access |
| FCA authorisation (for bank feeds) | Regulated Open Banking provider |
| GDPR compliance | Your data rights protected |

### HMRC Data Sharing

When you submit via MTD:
- HMRC receives quarterly summaries
- HMRC receives your final declaration
- Your full transaction list is NOT sent to HMRC

You keep detailed records; HMRC receives totals.
