Amazon Flex drivers are **self-employed** and must pay tax on their earnings. If you earn over £1,000 from Flex blocks, register for Self Assessment with HMRC, track your expenses (especially mileage), and file a tax return by 31 January each year. You can significantly reduce your tax bill by claiming allowable expenses.

This guide covers everything Amazon Flex drivers need to know about UK tax.

## Amazon Flex Employment Status

### You're Self-Employed, Not Employed

| Characteristic | Amazon Flex |
|----------------|-------------|
| Employment status | Self-employed |
| Employer responsibility | None from Amazon |
| Tax deduction | No PAYE (you pay your own tax) |
| NI deduction | No (you pay your own NI) |
| Holiday/sick pay | None |

Amazon treats you as an independent contractor. You're responsible for:
- Registering with HMRC
- Calculating your tax
- Filing Self Assessment
- Paying tax and NI

### What This Means

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| You receive gross pay | No tax deducted by Amazon |
| You must register | Self Assessment required (if over £1,000) |
| You can claim expenses | Reduce your tax bill |
| You pay NI | Class 2 and Class 4 |

## When to Register

### Earnings Over £1,000

Register for Self Assessment if your Amazon Flex earnings exceed **£1,000 per year**:

| Annual Earnings | Action Required |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Under £1,000 | No action (Trading Allowance covers it) |
| Over £1,000 | Register for Self Assessment |

### How to Register

1. Go to [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment)
2. Select "Self-employed or sole trader"
3. Describe your work (e.g., "Delivery driver")
4. Receive your UTR within 10 working days

**Deadline:** Register by 5 October following the tax year you started.

**Example:** Started Flex in November 2024 → Register by 5 October 2025

## Amazon Flex Income

### What to Report

Report all earnings from Amazon Flex:

| Income Type | Taxable? |
|-------------|----------|
| Block payments | Yes |
| Surge payments | Yes |
| Tips (if any) | Yes |
| All Flex earnings | Yes |

### Where to Find Your Earnings

| Source | How to Access |
|--------|---------------|

## Amazon Flex Expenses

### Mileage (Simplified Expenses)

The biggest expense for Flex drivers is mileage:

| Miles Per Year | Rate |
|----------------|------|
| First 10,000 | 45p per mile |
| Over 10,000 | 25p per mile |

### What Miles Count

| Journey | Claimable? |
|---------|-----------|
| Home to first collection point | No (commuting) |
| Collection point to delivery addresses | Yes |
| Between delivery addresses | Yes |
| Final delivery to home | Yes (if returning) |
| Home to return location for undelivered parcels | Yes |

**Note:** Your journey from home to the Amazon depot/collection point is treated as commuting and isn't claimable, unless it's different each day.

### Example: Mileage Calculation

**Weekly Flex blocks:**

| Item | Miles |
|------|-------|
| Average per block | 50 miles |
| Blocks per week | 5 |
| Weekly miles | 250 miles |
| Annual miles | 13,000 miles |

**Annual mileage claim:**

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| First 10,000 × 45p | £4,500 |
| Next 3,000 × 25p | £750 |
| **Total** | **£5,250** |

### Phone Expenses

You use your phone for the Flex app:

| Option | Claim |
|--------|-------|
| Business-only phone | 100% of contract |
| Personal phone (business use) | Business % of contract |

**Example:**
- Phone contract: £30/month
- Business use: 60%
- Annual claim: £30 × 60% × 12 = £216

### Car Insurance

If your personal insurance covers delivery work:

| Situation | Claim |
|-----------|-------|
| Standard policy (covers Flex) | Business % of premium |
| Additional delivery cover | 100% of extra premium |
| Hire and reward policy | Business % |

**Check your policy:** Standard car insurance may not cover delivery driving. You may need to add "hire and reward" cover.

### Other Allowable Expenses

| Expense | Claimable? |
|---------|-----------|
| Car washes (for work) | Yes (business %) |
| Parking for deliveries | Yes |
| Congestion charge | Yes (delivery days) |
| Toll roads | Yes (delivery journeys) |
| Phone mount | Yes |
| Delivery bags/trolley | Yes |
| Hi-vis vest | Yes |
| Hand warmers/gloves | Yes |
| Sat nav (if separate) | Yes |
| Car maintenance | Not with mileage method |

### Mileage vs Actual Costs

Choose one method:

| Method | What You Claim |
|--------|----------------|
| Simplified (mileage) | 45p/25p per mile |
| Actual costs | Fuel, insurance, repairs, depreciation, etc. |

**Recommendation:** Mileage method is simpler and often better for delivery drivers.

**Important:** Once you choose a method for a vehicle, you must stick with it for that vehicle.

## Calculating Your Tax

### Step 1: Calculate Profit

**Profit = Amazon Flex Earnings − Allowable Expenses**

### Step 2: Apply Personal Allowance

The first £12,570 of profit is tax-free.

### Step 3: Calculate Tax and NI

| Tax | Rate |
|-----|------|
| Income Tax | 20%/40%/45% |
| Class 2 NI | £3.45/week (if profit over £6,725) |
| Class 4 NI | 6%/2% of profits |

### Example: Full Calculation

**Tom: Part-Time Amazon Flex Driver**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Amazon Flex earnings | £18,000 |
| **Expenses:** | |
| Mileage (12,000 miles) | −£5,150 |
| Phone (60% business) | −£216 |
| Additional car insurance | −£120 |
| Parking/tolls | −£80 |
| **Total expenses** | **−£5,566** |
| **Taxable profit** | **£12,434** |

**Tax calculation:**

| Tax | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Personal Allowance | £12,434 − £12,570 | £0 taxable |
| Income Tax | £0 × 20% | £0 |
| Class 2 NI | £3.45 × 52 | £179 |
| Class 4 NI | (£12,434 − £12,570) × 6% | £0 |
| **Total tax** | | **£179** |

Tom pays only £179 in NI because his profit is below the Personal Allowance.

### Example: Higher Earnings

**Sarah: Full-Time Amazon Flex Driver**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Amazon Flex earnings | £32,000 |
| **Expenses:** | |
| Mileage (25,000 miles) | −£8,250 |
| Phone | −£300 |
| Car insurance (extra cover) | −£200 |
| Other expenses | −£150 |
| **Total expenses** | **−£8,900** |
| **Taxable profit** | **£23,100** |

**Tax calculation:**

| Tax | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Income Tax (20%) | (£23,100 − £12,570) × 20% | £2,106 |
| Class 2 NI | £3.45 × 52 | £179 |
| Class 4 NI | (£23,100 − £12,570) × 6% | £632 |
| **Total tax** | | **£2,917** |

## Amazon Flex Plus Other Income

### Day Job + Flex

If you're employed and do Flex on the side:

| Source | How Taxed |

| Income | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Salary | £30,000 |

If your day job uses your Personal Allowance, Flex profit is taxed at 20% from the first pound.

## Common Amazon Flex Mistakes

### 1. Not Tracking Mileage

Mileage is your biggest expense. Track from day one:
- Every delivery block
- Every mile driven
- Running total for the year

### 2. Forgetting Small Expenses

Everything adds up:
- Phone mount
- Delivery bags
- Car washes
- Parking

### 3. Not Registering

If you earn over £1,000, you must register. Late registration can cause problems.

### 4. Missing the Deadline

31 January is fixed. Late filing = £100 penalty minimum.

### 5. Wrong Insurance

Standard car insurance may not cover delivery work. Check your policy covers "hire and reward" or similar.

## Tips for Amazon Flex Drivers

### 1. Set Money Aside

Keep **25-30%** of earnings for tax. Don't spend it all.

### 2. Track From Day One

Start tracking mileage and expenses immediately, even if you're not sure you'll hit £1,000.

### 3. Use a Separate Bank Account

Makes tracking earnings and expenses much easier.

### 4. Get Proper Insurance

Ensure your car insurance covers delivery driving. Notify your insurer.

### 5. Keep Digital Records

Photograph receipts, use apps for mileage, store everything digitally.

## Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital) applies to self-employment income.

If your Flex earnings (combined with any other self-employment) exceed these thresholds, you'll need MTD-compatible software.

Most part-time Flex drivers won't hit these limits, but be aware if your income grows.
