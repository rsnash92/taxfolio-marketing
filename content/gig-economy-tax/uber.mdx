Uber drivers are self-employed and must pay tax on their earnings. You need to register for Self Assessment, file a tax return by 31 January, and pay Income Tax plus National Insurance on your profits. You can claim expenses including mileage (45p per mile), Uber service fees, phone costs, and vehicle-related expenses.

This guide covers everything UK Uber drivers need to know about tax.

## Are Uber Drivers Self-Employed?

Yes. Uber drivers are classified as **self-employed** for tax purposes. This means:

| Aspect | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Tax status | Self-employed sole trader |
| Tax return | Self Assessment required |
| Tax payment | You pay your own tax (not deducted by Uber) |
| Expenses | You can claim business costs |
| National Insurance | Class 2 and Class 4 |

**Note:** While a Supreme Court ruling in 2021 granted Uber drivers "worker" status for employment rights (minimum wage, holiday pay), you remain **self-employed for tax purposes**.

## Registering for Self Assessment

If you earn over £1,000 from Uber driving, you must register:

1. Go to [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment)
2. Select "Self-employed or sole trader"
3. Describe your business (e.g., "Private hire driver")
4. Provide personal details
5. Receive your UTR within 10 working days

**Deadline:** Register by 5 October following the tax year you started driving.

## What Income to Report

Report **all** fares received through the Uber app:

| Income Type | Report? |
|-------------|---------|
| Uber fares (passenger pays) | Yes |
| Uber tips | Yes |
| Surge pricing amounts | Yes |
| Promotions/bonuses from Uber | Yes |
| Cash tips from passengers | Yes |

### Where to Find Your Earnings

Uber provides an annual tax summary:

1. Open the Uber Driver app
2. Go to **Account** → **Tax Info** → **Tax Summary**
3. Download your annual statement

This shows:
- Total gross fares
- Uber service fee deducted
- Net amount paid to you
- Number of trips

**Important:** Report your **gross fares** as income, then claim the Uber service fee as an expense.

## Uber Driver Expenses

Claiming expenses reduces your taxable profit. Common Uber driver expenses:

### Vehicle Costs (Choose One Method)

**Option A: Mileage (Simplified)**

| Miles Per Year | Rate |
|----------------|------|
| First 10,000 | 45p per mile |
| Over 10,000 | 25p per mile |

Claim mileage for:
- Miles driven with passengers
- Miles driven to pick up passengers
- Miles driven between fares (if staying in an area)

**NOT claimable:**
- Commuting from home to first fare
- Driving home after last fare
- Personal trips

**Option B: Actual Costs**

If you use actual costs, claim business proportion of:

| Expense | Claimable |
|---------|-----------|
| Fuel | Business % |
| Insurance | Business % |
| Repairs and servicing | Business % |
| MOT | Business % |
| Road tax | Business % |
| Breakdown cover | Business % |
| Car wash | Business % |

**Business proportion** = Business miles ÷ Total miles

**You cannot use both methods.** Choose mileage OR actual costs.

### Uber Service Fees

Uber deducts a service fee (typically 25%) from each fare. This is a deductible expense.

**Example:**
- Passenger pays: £20
- Uber fee (25%): £5
- You receive: £15

Report £20 as income, claim £5 as expense.

### Phone and Data

| Expense | Claimable |
|---------|-----------|
| Phone contract | Business % |
| Mobile data | Business % |
| Phone mount/holder | Yes (if for driving) |
| Phone charger (car) | Yes |

Estimate business use (e.g., 70% if mainly used for Uber).

### Licensing and Compliance

| Expense | Claimable |
|---------|-----------|
| PCO/PHV licence fee | Yes |
| DBS check | Yes |
| Medical examination | Yes |
| DVLA licence check fee | Yes |
| Council licence fees | Yes |

### Other Allowable Expenses

| Expense | Claimable |
|---------|-----------|
| Sat nav app subscription | Yes |
| Dashcam | Yes |
| Car air fresheners | Yes |
| Water/snacks for passengers | Yes |
| Hi-vis jacket | Yes |
| First aid kit | Yes |
| Accountant fees | Yes |

### Non-Allowable Expenses

| Expense | Why Not Claimable |
|---------|-------------------|
| Parking/speeding fines | Penalties not allowable |
| Clothing (unless uniform) | Personal expense |
| Food for yourself | Personal expense |
| Home to work travel | Commuting |

## Calculating Your Tax

### Step 1: Calculate Profit

**Profit = Total Fares − Allowable Expenses**

### Step 2: Apply Tax Rates

**Income Tax:**

| Band | Rate |
|------|------|
| £0 – £12,570 | 0% (Personal Allowance) |
| £12,571 – £50,270 | 20% |
| £50,271 – £125,140 | 40% |

**National Insurance:**

| Type | Rate |
|------|------|
| Class 2 | £3.45/week (if profits over £6,725) |
| Class 4 | 6% on £12,570 – £50,270 |
| Class 4 | 2% above £50,270 |

### Example Tax Calculation

**Ahmed: Full-Time Uber Driver**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross fares | £42,000 |
| Uber service fees (25%) | −£10,500 |
| Mileage (25,000 miles) | −£8,000 |
| Phone (70% business) | −£420 |
| PCO licence | −£300 |
| Other expenses | −£500 |
| **Taxable Profit** | **£22,280** |

**Tax Calculation:**

| Tax | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Income Tax | 20% × (£22,280 − £12,570) | £1,942 |
| Class 2 NI | £3.45 × 52 | £179 |
| Class 4 NI | 6% × £9,710 | £583 |
| **Total Tax** | | **£2,704** |

**Effective tax rate:** 12.1%

## Tracking Mileage

Accurate mileage records are essential. Track:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Date | 15 January 2025 |
| Start mileage | 45,230 |
| End mileage | 45,312 |
| Business miles | 82 |
| Purpose | Uber driving shift |

### Mileage Tracking Options

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Paper logbook | Simple, no tech needed | Easy to forget |
| Spreadsheet | Easy to total | Manual entry |
| Mileage app (MileIQ, etc.) | Automatic tracking | Cost, battery use |
| Uber trip data | Shows trip miles | Doesn't include dead miles |

**Tip:** Use Uber's trip data as a starting point, then add miles driven between fares and to/from first and last pickups.

## Part-Time vs Full-Time

### Part-Time Uber (Under £1,000)

If your Uber earnings are under £1,000:
- The [Trading Allowance](/gig-economy-tax/trading-allowance) covers your income
- No need to register for Self Assessment
- No tax to pay

### Part-Time Uber (Over £1,000)

If you have a day job plus Uber:
- Register for Self Assessment
- Report employment income (from P60)
- Report Uber profit separately
- Tax calculated on combined income

**Example:**
- Employment income: £30,000 (taxed via PAYE)
- Uber profit: £8,000
- Total income: £38,000
- Additional tax on Uber: £8,000 × 20% = £1,600 (plus NI)

### Full-Time Uber

If Uber is your main income:
- All profit subject to Income Tax and NI
- Consider setting aside 25-30% for tax
- Budget for payments on account

## HMRC Reporting by Uber

From January 2024, Uber must report driver earnings to HMRC:

| Information Reported | Details |
|---------------------|---------|
| Your name and address | As registered with Uber |
| Total earnings | Gross fares for the year |
| Number of trips | Transaction count |

HMRC compares this data to your Self Assessment. Unreported income is likely to be identified.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Registering

If you earn over £1,000, you must register for Self Assessment. HMRC may contact you if Uber reports your earnings and you haven't filed.

### 2. Claiming Mileage AND Actual Costs

Choose one method only. You cannot claim 45p per mile AND claim fuel, insurance, etc.

### 3. Claiming Commuting Miles

Miles from home to your first pickup are not business miles. Start counting when you're available for fares.

### 4. Forgetting Tips

Cash tips are taxable income. Report all tips, even small amounts.

### 5. No Mileage Records

Without a log, HMRC can disallow mileage claims. Track your miles throughout the year.

## Vehicle Finance and Tax

### Hire Purchase (HP)

- Claim capital allowances on the vehicle
- Interest is a deductible expense (business proportion)

### Personal Contract Purchase (PCP)

- Monthly payments are not fully deductible
- Use mileage method instead (simpler)

### Lease/Rental

- Lease payments partially deductible
- Restrictions apply to high-emission vehicles
- Generally, mileage method is simpler

**Recommendation:** For most Uber drivers, the mileage method (45p/25p per mile) is simpler and often more generous than actual costs.

## Electric Vehicles for Uber

If you drive an electric vehicle:

- Same 45p/25p mileage rate applies
- Lower running costs = higher profit after mileage deduction
- 100% capital allowance if claiming actual costs
- Congestion charge exemption (London)

EVs can be tax-efficient for high-mileage Uber drivers.

## Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), you must comply with [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital):

- Keep digital records
- Submit quarterly updates to HMRC
- Use MTD-compatible software

If your Uber income plus any other self-employment/property income exceeds these thresholds, MTD applies.
