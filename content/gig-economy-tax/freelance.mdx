Freelancers in the UK are self-employed and must pay Income Tax and National Insurance on their profits. If you earn over £1,000 from freelancing, register for Self Assessment and file a tax return by 31 January each year. You can reduce your tax bill by claiming legitimate business expenses.

This guide covers everything UK freelancers need to know about tax, from registration to filing.

## Are Freelancers Self-Employed?

Yes. For tax purposes, freelancers are **self-employed sole traders**:

| Characteristic | Freelancer Status |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Work for multiple clients | Yes |
| Invoice for work | Yes |
| Set own hours/rates | Yes |
| Use own equipment | Usually |
| Tax status | Self-employed |
| Tax return | Self Assessment |

This applies whether you're a writer, designer, developer, consultant, photographer, or any other freelance profession.

## Registering for Self Assessment

### If You Earn Over £1,000

Register for Self Assessment:

1. Go to [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment)
2. Select "Self-employed or sole trader"
3. Enter your business type (e.g., "Freelance graphic designer")
4. Provide personal details
5. Receive your UTR within 10 working days

**Deadline:** Register by 5 October following the tax year you started freelancing.

### If You Earn Under £1,000

The [£1,000 Trading Allowance](/gig-economy-tax/trading-allowance) covers your income:
- No tax to pay
- No registration required

But if you want to claim expenses (to create a loss or for future years), you'll still need to register.

### Income Timing

Report income in the tax year you **earned** it (invoiced), not necessarily when paid:

| Basis | When to Report |

Most freelancers under £150,000 turnover use **cash basis** for simplicity.

## Calculating Your Tax Bill

### Step 1: Calculate Profit

**Profit = Total Income − Allowable Expenses**

### Step 2: Apply Income Tax

| Band | Taxable Amount | Rate |
|------|----------------|------|
| Personal Allowance | £0 – £12,570 | 0% |
| Basic Rate | £12,571 – £50,270 | 20% |
| Higher Rate | £50,271 – £125,140 | 40% |
| Additional Rate | Over £125,140 | 45% |

### Step 3: Apply National Insurance

| Type | Calculation |
|------|-------------|
| Class 2 | £3.45/week if profits over £6,725 |
| Class 4 | 6% on profits £12,570-£50,270 |
| Class 4 | 2% on profits over £50,270 |

### Example: Freelance Designer

**Sophie: Freelance Graphic Designer**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Client income | £48,000 |
| Software subscriptions | −£1,200 |
| Equipment (laptop, monitor) | −£1,800 |
| Home office (simplified) | −£312 |
| Phone and internet (60%) | −£576 |
| Travel to clients | −£840 |
| Professional insurance | −£350 |
| Accountant | −£300 |
| **Taxable Profit** | **£42,622** |

**Tax Calculation:**

| Tax | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Income Tax (0%) | £12,570 | £0 |
| Income Tax (20%) | £30,052 × 20% | £6,010 |
| Class 2 NI | £3.45 × 52 | £179 |
| Class 4 NI | £30,052 × 6% | £1,803 |
| **Total Tax** | | **£7,992** |

**Effective tax rate:** 18.8%

## Freelance vs Employed Contractor

### Determining Your Status

HMRC uses various tests to determine if you're genuinely self-employed:

| Factor | Self-Employed | Employed |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Control | You decide how to work | Client directs work |
| Substitution | Can send someone else | Must do it yourself |
| Mutuality | No ongoing obligation | Continuous relationship |
| Equipment | Provide your own | Client provides |
| Financial risk | Can profit or lose | Fixed wage |

### IR35 (Off-Payroll Working)

If you work through a limited company, **IR35** rules may apply:

- If inside IR35: taxed like an employee
- If outside IR35: normal company taxation

For **sole trader freelancers**, IR35 doesn't apply directly—you're already paying self-employed tax.

## Invoicing Best Practices

Your invoices should include:

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Your name and address | Sophie Jones, 14 High Street... |
| Client name and address | Acme Ltd, 20 Business Park... |
| Invoice number | INV-2025-042 |
| Invoice date | 15 January 2025 |
| Payment due date | 15 February 2025 |
| Description of work | Logo design and brand guidelines |
| Amount | £1,500.00 |
| Your payment details | Bank account, sort code |

**Keep copies** of all invoices for 6 years.

## Freelancing Plus Employment

Many freelancers have a day job plus freelance work:

| Source | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|
| Employment | Taxed via PAYE (employer deducts) |
| Freelance | Taxed via Self Assessment |

**Combined effect:**

Your freelance income is added to employment income:

| Income | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Employment salary | £35,000 |
| Freelance profit | £15,000 |
| **Total** | **£50,000** |

If total pushes you into higher rate band, freelance income may be taxed at 40%.

## Payment on Account

If your tax bill exceeds £1,000 (and less than 80% was deducted at source), you make advance payments:

| Payment | When | Amount |
|---------|------|--------|
| First payment on account | 31 January | 50% of previous year |
| Second payment on account | 31 July | 50% of previous year |
| Balancing payment | 31 January (following year) | Remainder |

**First year surprise:** Your first bill includes the full year PLUS 50% advance payment.

## VAT for Freelancers

### VAT Registration

You must register for VAT if:
- Turnover exceeds £90,000 in 12 months, OR
- You expect to exceed this in the next 30 days

### Voluntary Registration

You can register voluntarily below the threshold:
- Reclaim VAT on business purchases
- May appear more professional
- But adds admin and complexity

Most freelancers under £90,000 don't register.

## Record Keeping

Keep for **6 years**:

| Record | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Invoices issued | Proof of income |
| Bank statements | Transaction evidence |
| Expense receipts | Support deductions |
| Contracts | Terms of work |
| Mileage log | Travel claims |

## Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital) applies:

- Keep digital records
- Submit quarterly updates to HMRC
- Use MTD-compatible software

If your freelance income exceeds these thresholds, prepare now.

## Common Freelancer Mistakes

### 1. Not Setting Aside Tax

Freelance income arrives gross. Set aside **25-30%** for tax throughout the year.

### 2. Missing Expenses

Review expense categories carefully. Many freelancers under-claim.

### 3. No Separate Bank Account

Mixing business and personal makes bookkeeping harder. Use a dedicated account.

### 4. Late Filing

The deadline is 31 January. Late filing = £100 penalty minimum.

### 5. Forgetting Payments on Account

Budget for the first year payment on account shock.
