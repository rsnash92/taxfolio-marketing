  - question: "What is the Trading Allowance?"
    answer: "The Trading Allowance is a £1,000 tax-free allowance for income from self-employment, casual work, or selling goods and services. If your gross income is £1,000 or less, you don't need to register for Self Assessment or pay tax on this income."
  - question: "Do I need to tell HMRC if I earn under £1,000?"
    answer: "No. If your trading income is £1,000 or less and you're using the Trading Allowance, you don't need to register for Self Assessment or report the income. However, you can't also claim expenses against this income."
  - question: "Can I use the Trading Allowance and claim expenses?"
    answer: "No. You choose one or the other. Either use the £1,000 Trading Allowance (no expenses claimed) or report your full income and deduct actual expenses. Choose whichever gives lower taxable income."
  - question: "Does selling on eBay or Vinted count for the Trading Allowance?"
    answer: "It depends. Occasional sales of personal items aren't taxable at all. Regular selling with the intention of making profit is trading income—the Trading Allowance can apply if under £1,000. HMRC looks at frequency, intention, and whether you're buying to resell."

The Trading Allowance is a **£1,000 tax-free allowance** for self-employment and casual trading income. If your gross income from self-employment is £1,000 or less per tax year, you don't need to pay tax on it or register for Self Assessment. Above £1,000, you can choose to deduct the allowance instead of claiming actual expenses.

This guide explains who can use the Trading Allowance, how it works, and when claiming expenses is better.

## What is the Trading Allowance?

The Trading Allowance was introduced in April 2017 to simplify tax for people with small amounts of self-employment or casual income.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Amount | £1,000 per tax year |
| Who can use it | Individuals with trading income |
| Effect | Tax-free income up to £1,000 |
| Registration | Not required if income ≤ £1,000 |

### What Counts as Trading Income?

| Included | Not Included |
|----------|--------------|
| Freelance work | Employment (PAYE) income |
| Selling goods you make | Selling personal possessions |
| Casual services | Rental income (use Property Allowance) |
| Gig economy work | Investment income |
| Online selling (if trading) | Gifts |

## How the Trading Allowance Works

### Scenario 1: Income £1,000 or Less

If your total trading income is **£1,000 or less**:

- **Tax due:** £0
- **Registration required:** No
- **Report to HMRC:** No

You simply don't declare it. The allowance covers your entire income.

**Example:** You earn £800 from occasional babysitting.
- Trading income: £800
- Trading Allowance: £1,000
- Taxable: £0
- Action: Nothing required

### Scenario 2: Income Over £1,000

If your trading income exceeds £1,000, you have two options:

**Option A: Use the Trading Allowance**
- Deduct £1,000 from your income
- Pay tax on the remainder
- Cannot claim any expenses

**Option B: Claim Actual Expenses**
- Report full income
- Deduct actual business expenses
- Pay tax on the profit

**Choose whichever gives lower taxable income.**

### Comparison Example

**Sarah earns £3,000 from selling crafts online.**

| Method | Calculation | Taxable Income |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Option A:** Trading Allowance | £3,000 − £1,000 = £2,000 | £2,000 |
| **Option B:** Actual Expenses (£1,500 in materials, fees) | £3,000 − £1,500 = £1,500 | £1,500 |

**Best choice:** Actual expenses (£500 lower taxable income)

**Tom earns £2,500 from odd jobs.**

| Method | Calculation | Taxable Income |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Option A:** Trading Allowance | £2,500 − £1,000 = £1,500 | £1,500 |
| **Option B:** Actual Expenses (£400 in travel) | £2,500 − £400 = £2,100 | £2,100 |

**Best choice:** Trading Allowance (£600 lower taxable income)

## Who Can Use the Trading Allowance

### Eligible

- Sole traders
- Freelancers
- Casual workers
- Gig economy workers
- Online sellers (if trading)
- Anyone with miscellaneous self-employment income

### Not Eligible

You **cannot** use the Trading Allowance if:

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Income from your employer or spouse's employer | Prevents abuse of employment income |
| Income from a partnership you're in | Different rules apply |
| Income from a company you own | Connected parties excluded |
| Property income | Use Property Allowance instead |

### Multiple Sources

If you have multiple trading income sources, they're combined:

| Source | Income |
|--------|--------|
| Freelance design work | £600 |
| Selling crafts | £500 |
| **Total** | **£1,100** |

Total exceeds £1,000, so you must either:
- Deduct £1,000 Trading Allowance (pay tax on £100)
- Claim actual expenses across all trading activities

## Trading Allowance vs Property Allowance

There are two separate £1,000 allowances:

| Allowance | Applies To |
|-----------|------------|
| **Trading Allowance** (£1,000) | Self-employment, casual work, selling |
| **Property Allowance** (£1,000) | Rental income |

You can use **both** if you have both types of income.

**Example:** £800 from freelancing + £700 from renting a parking space
- Trading income (£800): Covered by Trading Allowance
- Property income (£700): Covered by Property Allowance
- Tax: £0 on both

**Note:** The £7,500 Rent a Room scheme is separate again and applies to renting a room in your main home.

## Common Trading Allowance Questions

### Does Selling on eBay/Vinted Count?

It depends on your intention and frequency:

| Situation | Treatment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Selling old clothes you no longer want | Not trading—no tax anyway |
| Occasional clear-out of personal items | Not trading—no tax |
| Regularly buying items to resell | Trading—Trading Allowance can apply |
| Running a side business selling | Trading—Trading Allowance or expenses |

**HMRC test:** Are you buying with the intention to sell at a profit? If yes, it's trading.

**From 2024:** Platforms like eBay, Vinted, and Etsy must report seller income to HMRC. High-volume sellers may be asked to explain their activity.

### What About Uber, Deliveroo, TaskRabbit?

Gig economy income is trading income:

| Platform | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| Uber/Bolt driving | Trading income |
| Deliveroo/Just Eat delivery | Trading income |
| TaskRabbit jobs | Trading income |
| Fiverr/Upwork freelancing | Trading income |

If your total gig income is under £1,000, the Trading Allowance covers it. Over £1,000, compare the allowance to actual expenses (vehicle costs, phone, etc.).

### Is Hobby Income Taxable?

A hobby becomes taxable when you're trading:

| Indicator | Hobby | Trading |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Intention | Personal enjoyment | Make profit |
| Frequency | Occasional | Regular |
| Scale | Small, casual | Organised, business-like |
| Commercial approach | None | Marketing, pricing strategy |

**Grey area:** If you sell some paintings from your hobby, HMRC looks at the overall picture. Occasional sales of hobby items may not be trading; systematic selling probably is.

### Can I Use the Allowance Every Year?

Yes. The £1,000 Trading Allowance applies each tax year. You can use it annually as long as:

- Your income qualifies
- You're not connected to the payer (employer, etc.)
- You don't claim expenses instead

### What If I'm Already Registered for Self Assessment?

If you're already registered and your trading income drops below £1,000:

- You can use the Trading Allowance for that income
- Still file your Self Assessment if required for other reasons
- Either show trading income as £0 (fully covered by allowance) or don't include it

## Platform Reporting to HMRC

From January 2024, digital platforms must report seller income to HMRC:

| Platform Type | Reports To HMRC |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Online marketplaces (eBay, Etsy, Vinted) | Yes |
| Gig economy (Uber, Deliveroo) | Yes |
| Freelance platforms (Fiverr, Upwork) | Yes |
| Rental platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com) | Yes |

**What's reported:**
- Your name and address
- Tax identification number (if provided)
- Total payments received
- Number of transactions

This doesn't automatically mean you owe tax—the Trading Allowance still applies. But HMRC can now see income you haven't declared.

## When to Register for Self Assessment

### Not Required

You don't need to register if:
- Total trading income is £1,000 or less, AND
- You're using the Trading Allowance, AND
- You have no other reason to file Self Assessment

### Required

You must register if:
- Trading income exceeds £1,000
- You want to claim actual expenses (even if income under £1,000)
- You have other Self Assessment obligations (employment income over £150k, rental income, etc.)

Register by **5 October** following the tax year: [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment)

## Making the Choice: Allowance vs Expenses

### Use the Trading Allowance If:

- Expenses are less than £1,000
- You want simplicity (no record-keeping required)
- Income is just over £1,000

### Claim Actual Expenses If:

- Expenses exceed £1,000
- You have significant costs (vehicle, materials, tools)
- You want to build a loss to carry forward

### Decision Flowchart

1. **Is trading income ≤ £1,000?**
   - Yes → Use allowance, nothing to report
   - No → Continue

2. **Are expenses > £1,000?**
   - Yes → Claim actual expenses
   - No → Use Trading Allowance

3. **Want to maximise deductions?**
   - Calculate both methods, choose lower taxable amount

## Record Keeping

### If Using the Allowance (Income ≤ £1,000)

- Keep informal records of income received
- No requirement to track expenses
- Retain records for **6 years** in case of HMRC query

### If Claiming Expenses

- Register for Self Assessment
- Track all income and expenses
- Keep receipts and invoices
- File tax return by 31 January
- Keep records for **6 years**

## Trading Allowance and Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital) applies to self-employment income.

If your trading income is under £1,000 and you're using the allowance, MTD doesn't apply to that income specifically. But if you have other qualifying income (larger self-employment or property), your total affairs come under MTD.

## Examples by Situation

### Example 1: Occasional Freelancer

**Income:** £800 from three freelance projects
**Expenses:** £150 (software subscription)

**Best choice:** Trading Allowance
- Income under £1,000: no tax, no reporting

### Example 2: Regular Gig Worker

**Income:** £4,500 from Deliveroo
**Expenses:** £2,000 (mileage, phone, equipment)

**Option A:** £4,500 − £1,000 allowance = £3,500 taxable
**Option B:** £4,500 − £2,000 expenses = £2,500 taxable

**Best choice:** Actual expenses (saves £200 tax at 20%)

### Example 3: eBay Seller

**Income:** £1,200 from reselling items
**Expenses:** £300 (postage, packaging, platform fees)

**Option A:** £1,200 − £1,000 allowance = £200 taxable
**Option B:** £1,200 − £300 expenses = £900 taxable

**Best choice:** Trading Allowance (£700 lower taxable income)

### Example 4: Craft Seller

**Income:** £2,800 from Etsy
**Expenses:** £1,800 (materials, shipping, fees)

**Option A:** £2,800 − £1,000 allowance = £1,800 taxable
**Option B:** £2,800 − £1,800 expenses = £1,000 taxable

**Best choice:** Actual expenses (£800 lower taxable income)
