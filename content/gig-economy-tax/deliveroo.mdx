Deliveroo riders are self-employed and must pay tax on their delivery earnings. You need to register for Self Assessment if you earn over £1,000, file a tax return by 31 January, and pay Income Tax plus National Insurance on your profits. You can claim expenses including bike repairs, mileage (if using a vehicle), phone costs, and delivery equipment.

This guide covers everything UK Deliveroo riders need to know about tax.

## Are Deliveroo Riders Self-Employed?

Yes. Deliveroo riders are classified as **self-employed** for tax purposes:

| Aspect | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Tax status | Self-employed sole trader |
| Tax return | Self Assessment required (if over £1,000) |
| Tax payment | You pay your own tax |
| Expenses | You can claim business costs |
| Flexibility | You choose when to work |

This also applies to riders for Just Eat, Uber Eats, Stuart, and other delivery platforms.

## Do I Need to Register?

### If You Earn Over £1,000

Register for Self Assessment:

1. Go to [gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment)
2. Select "Self-employed or sole trader"
3. Describe your work (e.g., "Food delivery rider")
4. Receive your UTR within 10 working days

**Deadline:** Register by 5 October following the tax year you started.

### If You Earn Under £1,000

The [£1,000 Trading Allowance](/gig-economy-tax/trading-allowance) covers your income:
- No tax to pay
- No registration required
- No return to file

**Example:** You earn £800 from Deliveroo over the year. No tax action needed.

| Tips (through app) | Yes |
| Cash tips | Yes |
| Bonuses and incentives | Yes |
| Referral bonuses | Yes |

### Finding Your Earnings

Access your earnings in the Deliveroo rider app:

The summary shows:

## Deliveroo Rider Expenses

Claiming expenses reduces your taxable profit.

### Bicycle Expenses

If you deliver by bicycle:

| Expense | Claimable |
|---------|-----------|

| New tyres and tubes | Yes |
| Lights and reflectors | Yes |
| Lock | Yes |

**Bicycle mileage:** You can claim **20p per mile** for bicycle business use, though most riders claim actual costs instead as they're often higher.

### Scooter/Motorbike Expenses

If you deliver by scooter or motorbike:

**Option A: Mileage**

| Motorcycle | 24p per mile |

## Calculating Your Tax

### Step 1: Calculate Profit

**Profit = Total Deliveroo Earnings − Allowable Expenses**

### Step 2: Apply Tax Rates

**Income Tax:**

| Band | Rate |
|------|------|
| £0 – £12,570 | 0% |
| £12,571 – £50,270 | 20% |
| £50,271 – £125,140 | 40% |

**National Insurance:**

| Type | Rate |
|------|------|
| Class 2 | £3.45/week (profits over £6,725) |
| Class 4 | 6% on £12,570 – £50,270 |

### Example: Part-Time Cyclist

**Priya: Part-Time Deliveroo Rider (Bicycle)**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Deliveroo earnings | £6,500 |
| Bicycle repairs | −£180 |
| Phone (60% business) | −£216 |
| Thermal bag | −£30 |
| Waterproof jacket | −£60 |
| **Taxable Profit** | **£6,014** |

**Tax:** £0 (profit below Personal Allowance)

### Example: Full-Time Scooter Rider

**Marcus: Full-Time Rider (Scooter)**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Deliveroo earnings | £28,000 |
| Mileage (15,000 miles × 24p) | −£3,600 |
| Phone (70% business) | −£336 |
| Equipment | −£200 |
| Insurance (additional for delivery) | −£400 |
| **Taxable Profit** | **£23,464** |

**Tax Calculation:**

| Tax | Calculation | Amount |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Income Tax | 20% × (£23,464 − £12,570) | £2,179 |
| Class 2 NI | £3.45 × 52 | £179 |
| Class 4 NI | 6% × £10,894 | £654 |
| **Total Tax** | | **£3,012** |

**Effective tax rate:** 12.8%

## Multiple Platforms

Many riders work for several platforms:

| Platform | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| Deliveroo | Combined as one self-employment |
| Uber Eats | Combined |
| Just Eat | Combined |
| Stuart | Combined |

All delivery income is reported together. Expenses are also combined.

**Example:**
- Deliveroo: £8,000
- Uber Eats: £5,000
- Just Eat: £3,000
- **Total delivery income:** £16,000

Claim expenses once (not per platform).

## Deliveroo Plus Day Job

If you have employment income plus Deliveroo:

| Income Source | How Taxed |
|---------------|-----------|
| Employment (PAYE) | Tax deducted by employer |
| Deliveroo (self-employment) | Tax via Self Assessment |

**Example:**

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Employment salary | £25,000 |
| Deliveroo profit | £5,000 |
| **Total income** | **£30,000** |

Your Deliveroo profit is added to your employment income. If total exceeds £12,570, you'll pay tax on the Deliveroo portion.

## Tracking Your Deliveries

Keep records of:

| Record | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Weekly earnings | Total income |
| Number of deliveries | Context for expenses |
| Miles travelled | If claiming mileage |
| Expenses | Receipts and invoices |

### Mileage Tracking

If using a vehicle, track:
- Date
- Starting point
- Ending point
- Miles for deliveries
- Purpose (deliveries)

The Deliveroo app shows delivery routes, but not travel between orders. Track total miles during your delivery sessions.

## Platform Reporting to HMRC

From 2024, Deliveroo reports rider earnings to HMRC:

| Reported | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Your name | As registered |
| Your address | As registered |
| Total earnings | Gross amount |
| Number of deliveries | Transaction count |

HMRC cross-references this with your Self Assessment. Ensure you report all income.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Registering (Over £1,000)

If earnings exceed £1,000, you must register. HMRC receives data from Deliveroo and may investigate unreported income.

### 2. Forgetting Tips

Tips through the app AND cash tips are taxable. Report all tips.

### 3. No Expense Records

Keep receipts for everything you claim. Without proof, HMRC can disallow expenses.

### 4. Claiming Personal Items

Only claim items used for delivery. Your regular clothes aren't claimable; delivery-specific waterproofs are.

### 5. Missing the Deadline

File by 31 January. Late filing means a £100 penalty minimum.

## Student Riders

If you're a student doing Deliveroo:

| Consideration | Impact |
|---------------|--------|
| Personal Allowance | Still £12,570 tax-free |
| Student loan | Earnings may affect repayments |
| Under £1,000 | Trading Allowance applies |
| Over £1,000 | Must register for Self Assessment |

Deliveroo income counts as earned income and may affect student finance if you earn significantly.

## Making Tax Digital

From April 2026 (income over £50,000) or April 2027 (over £30,000), [Making Tax Digital](/making-tax-digital) applies.

Most Deliveroo riders won't hit these thresholds from delivery alone. If you have other income sources that push you above the limit, MTD applies to all self-employment income.
