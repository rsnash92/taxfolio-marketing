# Taxfolio SEO Topical Map

Strategic Content Architecture for Making Tax Digital & Self Assessment

---

## Strategic Overview

This topical map establishes Taxfolio as the authoritative resource for Making Tax Digital (MTD) compliance and self-assessment in the UK. With the April 2026 deadline approaching for taxpayers earning over £50,000, search demand for MTD-related queries will surge throughout 2025-2026.

**Content Architecture:**
- **7 pillar pages** — Comprehensive topic hubs at root level for maximum SEO value
- **80+ cluster articles** — Focused subtopics nested under pillars
- **/resources** — Discovery index page linking to all content
- **/blog** — Time-sensitive news, product updates, and thought leadership
- **/compare** — Bottom-of-funnel competitor comparisons

This structure captures traffic at every stage of the buyer journey—from awareness ("what is MTD?") to decision ("best MTD software").

### Content Types

| Type | Purpose | Update Frequency | Word Count |
|------|---------|------------------|------------|
| Pillar | Comprehensive topic hub, SEO authority | Quarterly refresh | 2,500-4,000 |
| Cluster | Focused subtopic, supports pillar | Annually or as needed | 1,000-2,000 |
| Comparison | Bottom-funnel conversion | Quarterly | 1,500-2,500 |
| Blog | News, features, thought leadership | Weekly/as needed | 500-1,200 |

### Hub and Spoke Model
Each pillar page acts as a comprehensive hub covering a major topic. Cluster articles explore specific subtopics in depth and link back to their parent pillar. This structure signals topical authority to search engines and creates clear user pathways.

### Interlinking Strategy
Every cluster article links to:
1. Its parent pillar page
2. 2-3 related clusters within the same pillar
3. 1-2 relevant clusters from other pillars

Pillar pages link to all their clusters and cross-link to other pillars where relevant.

### Search Intent Types
- **Informational** — Learning/research queries
- **Commercial** — Comparing solutions
- **Transactional** — Ready to buy
- **Navigational** — Finding specific pages
