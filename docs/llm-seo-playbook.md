## 1. LLM SEO Checklist V1 — Your Master Checklist

This is the core framework. Apply these to every piece of content:

### Semantic Content Strategy

| Checklist Item | Taxfolio Application |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Build Entity-First Pages** | Each pillar page should clearly define Taxfolio as the main entity, plus supporting entities like HMRC, Making Tax Digital, SA100, TrueLayer, etc. Use `sameAs` schema linking to your LinkedIn, Companies House listing, etc. |
| **Use Semantic Triples** | Write sentences as Subject → Predicate → Object. Example: "Taxfolio → submits → SA100 returns directly to HMRC" or "Making Tax Digital → requires → quarterly digital submissions" |
| **Optimise Internal Linking** | Use descriptive anchors: "Learn more about MTD quarterly submission requirements" not "click here" |
| **Build Contextual Bridges** | Connect topics with causal sentences: "AI categorisation saves time because it eliminates manual transaction sorting" |
| **Add Definition Blocks** | Every pillar should define its core term clearly so LLMs can quote it: "Making Tax Digital is a UK government initiative requiring self-employed individuals and landlords to keep digital records and submit quarterly updates to HMRC." |

### On-Page & Structural SEO

| Checklist Item | Taxfolio Application |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Add About/Author/Contact Entities** | Create /about page linking to your LinkedIn, Companies House, Crunchbase. Add founder bio with `sameAs` links. |
| **Use Knowledge Panel Markers** | Implement Organization schema with `sameAs` pointing to TrueLayer partnership, FCA registration mention, etc. |
| **Build Entity Hubs** | Your 7 pillars ARE entity hubs. MTD cluster (10-15 pages), Self Assessment cluster (12 pages), etc. |
| **Optimise First Sentence** | Lead every article with the answer. Example: "Self assessment registration takes 10 working days and requires your National Insurance number and UTR." |
| **Use Inline Citations** | Link factual claims to HMRC.gov.uk, GOV.UK, ONS data. Example: "According to HMRC guidance (2025), MTD becomes mandatory for those earning over £50,000 from April 2026." |

### Technical/Crawl Optimisation

| Checklist Item | Taxfolio Application |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Crawl Efficiency** | Keep content within 3 clicks: Homepage → Pillar → Cluster |
| **Content Indexing** | Submit XML sitemap, use IndexNow for instant indexing of new content |
| **Semantic HTML5** | Use `<article>`, `<section id="what-is-mtd">`, `<section id="deadlines">`, `<aside>` for related content |

### Authority & Trust Signals

| Checklist Item | Taxfolio Application |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Contextual Backlinks** | Target backlinks from accounting blogs, UK fintech sites, HMRC-adjacent content |
| **Knowledge Graph Connections** | Add Taxfolio to Crunchbase, consider Wikidata entry as you grow |
| **Branded Mentions** | PR releases: "Taxfolio, the AI-powered self assessment software for UK freelancers and landlords" |

### AI Visibility Testing

| Checklist Item | Taxfolio Application |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Test Entity Recognition** | Regularly ask ChatGPT/Perplexity: "What is Taxfolio?" and "What MTD software is best for UK freelancers?" |
| **Monitor Citations** | Track when AI tools cite your content in responses |
| **Consensus Retrieval** | Ensure your brand description is consistent across website, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, press releases |

3. **Consistency everywhere** — Same brand description, same founder bio, same value proposition across all platforms

4. **Citations over backlinks** — The goal is to be cited by sources that AI systems trust, not just any backlink

This playbook is built for the AI search era. Traditional SEO still matters, but the goal is now to become a trusted source that LLMs cite and reference.
